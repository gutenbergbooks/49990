<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">The</span> object aimed at in the following pages is to
show the place that women have held in our national
life, from the days when what we call the Saxon
race was dominant in England, down to the present
time. For this purpose those phases of our social
history have been dwelt upon which display most
clearly the changes that have taken place in the
position of women, and the influence of great forces
like the Church and Feudalism. Names have been
used as illustrations, and not with any intention of
adding to biographical literature. Instances that
are the most striking individually do not always
serve best as examples. For this reason many
familiar historical scenes and figures have been
omitted. The continuity of a general record would
be broken by divergence into episodes interesting
on account of their exceptional character. Prominence
has been given to domestic life, as that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
concerns the larger number, and to those aspects of
the case which have not been summed up in the
numerous accounts of noteworthy women.</p>

<p>In literature and art, which have their own
special histories, where the part that women have
played is recounted at length, only a few general
points have been noted in order to show how women
have stood in relation to letters and art in successive
periods. The subjects themselves are treated as
stages marking social advance, not discussed in the
light of their intrinsic interest and attractiveness.</p>

<p>A consideration of the position of women in
England leads, naturally, to the subject of their
position in Europe generally, for the main influences
which have affected women in this country are the
same as those that have operated on the Continent,
although the result has taken different forms in
accordance with the idiosyncracies of each nation.
It is unnecessary to discuss the condition of women
in the Eastern parts, for while Western Europe has
been changing and progressing with ever-increasing
rapidity during the last ten centuries, Eastern
Europe&mdash;as far as social life is concerned&mdash;remained
for a long period in an almost stationary state. In
character it was Asiatic, though during the last
three hundred years it has succumbed more to the
influences of its geographical position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
In the Middle Ages the conditions of life in
Western Europe were pretty uniform. There was
hardly any education in the sense of book-learning,
except among religious communities. Locomotion
was difficult and dangerous, so that there was but
scanty intercourse between the inhabitants of different
parts of the same country. Fighting was the
chief business of men, and manual work, skilled
and unskilled, occupied women of all ranks.</p>

<p>In an age when war was so frequent, the civil
duties of life were left to women, who fulfilled obligations
that in more peaceful times fell to the lot of men.
They not only had entire charge of the household,
but shared largely in the operations of the field and
the farm; they were the spinners, the weavers, the
brewsters, and the bakers. They frequently controlled
the management of estates, and occasionally
held public offices of trust and importance. There
were no laws to prevent women from filling such
positions, and the fittest came to the front unhampered
by conventionality or arbitrary restrictions.
But although women appear to have had a wider
field of activity than they afterwards enjoyed, when
social life became more complex, there was a counteracting
influence which told against the development
and free exercise of their energies. This was the
influence of the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
It was the policy of the Church to keep women
in a subordinate position. As long as they remained
thoroughly convinced of their natural inferiority,
and of the duty of subservience, they
could be reckoned upon as valuable aids to the
building up of the ecclesiastical power. The
immense force of the religious and devotional spirit
in woman was at the absolute disposal of her
spiritual directors. At a time when there was no
science, no art, and, for the majority, no literature,
the power of the Church was incomparably greater
than anything we can conceive of now.</p>

<p>The Church did not find it difficult to persuade
women to accept the limits marked out for them.
There was no public sentiment to set off against
the power of the priest. Society was ruled by
physical force; the law was weak, and the Church
was women’s shelter from the rudeness of an age
when those who should have protected the defenceless
were themselves the greatest offenders.</p>

<p>In order to enforce the doctrine of inferiority,
the Church went further, and proclaimed that there
was in woman a wickedness additional to the sin
common to humanity. The “eternal feminine” was
held before men’s eyes as a temptation to be warred
against. To fly from the presence of woman was
to resist evil. Celibacy was a saintly virtue, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
family life a thing to be tolerated rather than approved.
In the words of St. Chrysostom, woman
was “a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a
desirable calamity, a domestic peril, a deadly fascination,
and a painted ill.” The influence of the
Fathers was not confined to their own age; their
writings continued to affect the whole teaching of
the Church, Anglican as well as Roman, which has
always been in favour of the subordination of
woman. She has been assigned a lower place in
religious exercises, and has been excluded from the
priestly office.</p>

<p>In successive periods of history the Church was
largely responsible for the terrible persecutions
inflicted upon women&mdash;and chiefly upon the poorest
and most helpless&mdash;on the ground of witchcraft.
Once having disseminated the theory of woman’s
inherent vice, it was only a natural corollary to
impute to her both the desire and the power of
working extraordinary mischief. The doctrine
suited ages which believed not only in an embodied
and omnipresent Power of Evil, but also in countless
and multiform expressions of that power through
natural objects and phenomena.</p>

<p>The Feudal System, which prevailed in England
up to the middle of the fifteenth century, and in
France up to a much later period, had a repressive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">x</a></span>
effect on women of the lower classes, though for
women in the upper ranks it presented certain
advantages. The women of the families of tenants
on a feudal estate were regarded as chattels which
went with the land. They were bound to the soil,
and were fined if they either accepted work or
married outside the lord’s domain.</p>

<p>The age of chivalry had a twofold effect on the
position of women. It created an ideal of womanhood
which stirred the imagination and the poetic
fancy. Chivalry had its sublime side. It was a
protest against tyranny and vice; it inspired men to
heroic deeds; it gave them a loftier conception of
duty. It was the revulsion of noble minds from the
coarseness, the unpitying indifference to wrong, and
contempt for weakness, which characterized the
Middle Ages. Like a new gospel, chivalry dawned
upon a world in which the virtues of Paganism had
declined, while its vices still triumphed.</p>

<p>But chivalry had another side. The pure reverence
for woman passed into romantic admiration,
into a worship of physical beauty, into mere passion.
Woman, from being little less than a saint, became a
toy. The teaching of the Church and the spirit
of chivalry both acted adversely on the position of
woman. By the one she was lowered below the
level of humanity, by the other she was raised to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
an ideal pinnacle, where it was impossible she could
remain. The fault was the same in both cases.
The priest and the knight removed woman from
her natural place into a false position, endowing
her with sub-human wickedness and superhuman
excellencies.</p>

<p>With the Renaissance and the spread of education,
social life underwent great changes. The
Church was no longer the dominant influence.
Great secular forces came into play; the tide of
learning swept over Europe; commerce, travel,
discoveries, inventions, caused old habits to be
unlearnt. Thought, which had been stagnant, was
freshened into a moving stream. In the intellectual
re-birth, in the conflict of faiths, in the deadly
political struggles which occupied the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries in England, we see how
women were passing from the narrow life of the
home into the wide life of the nation.</p>

<p>The great industrial revolution, which began in
the last century, and has progressed with such rapid
strides, has had its special bearing on the position of
women. The material improvements brought about
by machinery and developing trade, have lifted the
middle-class woman out of the purely domestic
sphere by lessening her household duties, and so
leaving her free for other occupations. She has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
ceased to be a producer. But the working woman
has been simply drawn more and more from family
life, to be absorbed into the ranks of outside workers.
She is, in many cases, as much detached from the
home as the man, by the necessity of wage-earning.</p>

<p>The educational revolution of modern times has
also worked great changes in the position of women
in England. It has specially affected the middle
classes, who have been thereby enabled to enter
with perfect freedom into the world of letters, to
follow professional and business careers&mdash;in a word,
to carve out for themselves an independent course.
A new conception has arisen of what is woman’s
place in society. She now bears an active part in
all the great movements&mdash;political, religious, philanthropic;
her co-operation is sought in public work,
and her presence welcomed, rather than resented,
in all new social enterprises.</p>

<p>In the lighter side of life&mdash;in its recreations,
which are now more in the nature of work than play&mdash;women
have a much wider field than formerly, and
take their pleasure as best suits them, without let or
hindrance. They are free to act according to their
necessities and tastes, wherever common sense and
fitness lead them, without finding the barrier of sex
laid across the path. Those who are afraid lest the
world should suffer by women adopting modes of life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
unsanctioned by tradition, may console themselves
by remembering that Nature is stronger than fashion
or opinion, and will at once make her voice heard
whenever the lightest of her laws is transgressed.</p>

<p>The position of women in England cannot be
regarded as an orderly evolution. It does not show
unvarying progress from age to age. In one
direction there has been improvement, in another
deterioration. There have been breaks and gaps
in the general advance, so that certain periods
appear at a disadvantage in comparison with their
predecessors. The last half-century shows very
rapid and momentous changes. Never were such
advantages placed within the reach of women;
never were so many opportunities&mdash;social, literary,
educational, commercial&mdash;open to them. But these
advantages and opportunities would have been
useless if women had not been ready, and shown
their fitness for the new trusts. They have themselves
largely created the public sentiment which
now so strongly impels them towards wider action,
and imposes on them greater responsibilities.</p>

Paston and her daughters&mdash;Lady Joan Berkeley&mdash;The

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">To</span> those living in the hurry and bustle of modern
existence, there are few pictures so attractive as
that of a stately manor-house in olden times. Its
seclusion and calm, the solidity, regularity, and
simplicity of its daily life, are a soothing contrast to
the noise and complexity of the common round in
the present day. We are accustomed to think of
the Middle Ages as a period of strife, of rude
commotions, with a generally unsettled state of
society. It was so, but with it all there was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
great peace which this generation knoweth not.
Fighting and brawling there was in plenty. Life
was cheap, property insecure; every man was
his own policeman; quarrels meant blows, and
might was right. But the very causes which produced
this state of society created also an opposite
condition of things. Bad roads, lack of communication,
which made it possible for deeds of violence
to pass unpunished, kept the knowledge of those
deeds hidden from the community at large. Life
went on in quiet corners undisturbed by the thought
of evil and misfortune close at hand. There was
no responsive throb of feeling between one town
and another, no electric thrill passing from country-side
to country-side. Each place lived its life
comparatively apart. To-day a touch on any of
our great centres of life is felt throughout the
kingdom. In mediæval times England was not a
whole, but a conglomeration of communities, each
with an independent existence.</p>

<p>The manor-house was essentially a self-contained
domain. Even the best of country roads were so
indifferent that a town a few miles off was not much
more than a name to most of the occupants of
the manor-house. What were called high-roads
were merely tracks along which waggons were
dragged with the utmost difficulty. The house itself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
embowered in trees on low-lying ground or sheltering
against the breast of a hill, was in its isolation both
defenceless and secure. Generally, it had a palisade
or outer fence to form a protection against assault.
That a house of any pretensions should be something
in the nature of a stronghold was necessary
in those days.</p>

<p>The upper story was reserved for the lady and
her maidens. It was the part most protected, and
was sometimes strengthened further by the placing
of heavy doors at short intervals on the staircase
which led to this portion of the house. Originally
consisting of only one apartment called the solar,
this upper floor was gradually enlarged until it
comprised several sleeping-rooms, the hall becoming
more and more a place for dining and receiving
guests and transacting business, while the real
family life was lived upstairs. Mediæval manners
necessitated some retreat where the women-folk
would not be exposed to contact with any passing
stranger who might claim hospitality. It seems,
however, to have been customary for the lady of the
house to sit with her lord, or, in his absence, to
preside at the dinner or supper taken in the hall.
Her place was at the upper end, away from the
entrance, and only privileged guests would be
permitted to sit close to her. There was a full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
acknowledgment of the wife’s social position. To
women of rank and station the feudal system
brought certain advantages. Every feudal lord
was a kind of princeling, and his wife shared
his dignities. The state kept up in the feudal
castle and in the mediæval manor-house gave
the wife considerable importance. As far as
social duties went, husband and wife acted as
partners, receiving and entertaining the guests
together. The unsettled times, which so often
kept the lord from his own roof, brought the
lady into prominence as sole guardian of the
family possessions and interests. She was hedged
round with a little circle of ceremony. A great
lady always had a body-guard of maidens who
lived under the eye of their mistress, while the lord
had a similar contingent of pages or squires. It
was a general custom in feudal times, and even
somewhat later, for the daughters and sons of good
families to be sent to live in the household of some
knight or gentleman to be instructed in all the
arts pertaining to their station. Feudal etiquette
required that a great lady should be personally
served by ladies of rank. With this personal
service was combined training in all domestic
accomplishments which it was necessary for a well-bred
maiden to acquire. The English fashion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
sending children from home was commented on by
foreigners as a proof of the lack of parental affection.
It was a fashion that was in full vogue in the middle
of the fifteenth century. In 1469, Dame Margaret
Paston writes to her son, Sir John Paston, about his
sister <span class="locked">Margery&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I wuld ye shuld purvey for yur suster to be with my
Lady of Oxford, or with my Lady of Bedford, or in sume
other wurchepfull place, wher as ye thynk best, and I
wull help to her fyndyng, for we be eyther of us werye of
other.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Dame Paston’s blunt letter seems to bear out the
charge brought against English parents.</p>

<p>A knight’s lady was like the mistress of a
boarding-school, and a very stern mistress she
often proved to be. Rank and birth did not
exempt her pupils from strict discipline and hard
work. While their brothers were learning to ride
and to wrestle, to shoot, and to handle the battle-axe,
to sing and to learn to bear themselves gallantly
like gentlemen, the maidens were being initiated
into the mysteries of weaving, spinning, brewing,
distilling, salting, and many other processes which
were then performed by each family for itself. To
these occupations was added needlework of all
kinds, from the making of plain serviceable smocks
and cloaks to embroidering banners and altar-cloths;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
for all wearing apparel, as well as everything
required for household use, was manufactured and
made up at home. If the male members of the
establishment were numerous, a busy time the lady
and her maidens must have had. Well might the
poet <span class="locked">write&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Mult doit fame estre chier tenue<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>No doubt the coarser kinds of work, such as
the clothes for dependants, were given out to the
servants; but every young gentlewoman had to
learn the process, so as to be able in her turn to
superintend a household. Tailors were also employed
for the making of both women’s and men’s
garments. In royal households there were regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
tailors who made feminine as well as masculine
garments. A tailor was called a cissor. In the
time of Edward I., the King, the Queen, and the
Prince of Wales each had their separate tailors.</p>

<p>There were large establishments of celibate
priests, like that of Bishop Swinfield who lived in
the thirteenth century, where no female servants
were permitted to enter, and men performed all
the domestic work. Unless the nuns of some
neighbouring convent were employed in working
for these semi-monastic households, there must
have been a supply of masculine weavers and
spinners. Curiously enough, the only in-door employment
in these priests’ houses for which female
labour was engaged was that of brewing. The
brewing was always exclusively in the hands of
women, and it is thought possible that even in
ecclesiastical establishments the old custom was
followed.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages it was not usual for women
to be employed about the royal palaces except to
attend on the queen and princesses. In France,
says Meiners, in his “History of the Female Sex”&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“When the kings lived apart from their consorts, they
had in their palaces no persons of the female sex, except
a few of those menials whose services are indispensably
necessary in every family, such as washerwomen, needle-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>women,
etc., and even these were removed by Philip the
Fair from his court. In like manner the palaces and
apartments of the queens and princesses were inaccessible
to all persons of the other sex, except the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maître de l’hotel</i>
and the knights or esquires who mounted guard before
the doors and chambers of the princesses. At table, in
rising and going to bed, in undressing and dressing, queens
and princesses were attended only by their women and
maids; and this ancient practice was retained by the
queens of France so late as the sixteenth century.”</p></blockquote>

<p>But to return to the manor-house. A great
lady, who had to superintend and take an active
share in the <em>making</em> only of the clothes for the
household, would in these days feel herself very
hardly pressed, especially if she were also expected
to be her own housekeeper and see to the good
ordering of the kitchen. But if she had also to
manufacture material and to preside over all those
initial processes of which she now sees nothing but
the results, life would seem an intolerable burden. It
was not so thought in mediæval times. It is true
that in noblemen’s houses there was a steward,
whose business it was to provide the household
with necessaries. In the Berkeley family, which
may be taken as a typical case, in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries, the steward was accustomed
to order, either monthly or quarterly,
certain quantities of provisions to be supplied from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the manors and farms belonging to the estate. But
the lady of the house exercised a general superintendence.
Joan, the wife of Thomas, third Lord
Berkeley, who lived in the reign of Edward III., is
described <span class="locked">as&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“a vertuous lady and great huswife and a wise overseer of
such household affayres as were proper to her sex and
government.... When shee came to theis farm-houses
(as often shee did) to oversee or take accompt of her dairy
affaires, shee oftentimes spent in provisions at a meale there
the valewe of 4<i>d.</i> and 4<i>d.</i> ob. [4¼<i>d.</i> about] whereof allowance
was afterwards given to the Accomptant before her
husband’s Auditor at the end of the year. And some
tymes also a cheese of two pound weight was at such
a tyme spent by her attendants. And in such huswifely
courses this virtuous Lady spent a part of her aged and
weake yeares untill her death.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There was a dignity attached to manual labour
which is exemplified in the use of the word “spinster.”
It was a term of which women were proud.
We now confine it to unmarried women, but as late as
the sixteenth century it was used by married women
of the better class. A gentlewoman who married
a man of inferior rank claimed the title of spinster
as a sign of her good birth and gentle breeding.</p>

<p>Life was, however, by no means all work for the
ladies of the manor-house. There was time and to
spare for lighter employments and diversions. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
hear a great deal of games, especially of chess, in
the households of people of rank, and the number
of so-called chamber games shows that the ladies
had many hours for recreation. There was dancing
too, and lute-playing, and a little conning over
ballads and romances. For although the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">damoiseaux</i>
frequently could not sign their names, and found it
hard work to spell out the words of the breviary,
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demoiselles</i>, if they were not very skilful with
the quill, were fairly proficient in the art of reading,
which was more cultivated by women than by men.</p>

<p>In the intervals between needlework and housewifery,
there would be strolling in the garden on
fine days, weaving garlands of flowers&mdash;a favourite
mediæval pastime; and in summer weather, when
the lanes were passable, rambles outside the domain
and occasional rides. It is easy to understand
how much more essential was the garden to the
enjoyment of the women-folk in days when out-door
exercise was comparatively difficult. There
would be a little visiting among the dependents in
the hamlet, and for the lady herself, in cold wet
seasons, a great dispensing of herbal medicines for
rheums and ague. At all times there were the
doles to the poor, gifts which were thought due
from the great house. Religious observances
occupied a portion of each day, though the length<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
and number of these depended on the character of
the inmates. Still, there would be certain outward
forms of devotion to be gone through in almost all
large households. Few great ladies were so
punctilious in their devotions as the Princess Cecil,
mother of Edward IV., who used to rise at seven
o’clock and say matins with her chaplain. After
that she heard a low mass in her chamber. A little
later in the morning, when the slight breakfast had
been partaken of, she would go to the chapel to
hear divine service and two low masses. She said
evensong with her chaplain, and then went again to
chapel.</p>

<p>In ordinary households the saints’ days would
be observed, the great fasts kept, and mass heard
at regular intervals. Sometimes the abbot of the
neighbouring monastery would pay what might be
called a pastoral visit to the lord and lady of the
manor, accompanied by some of his monks, mounted
on mules, accustomed to pace the rough or miry
roads. Besides these clerical visitors, there would
be strangers to be entertained every now and then,
and if they were of high degree, the lady herself
would see that their wants were supplied, and would
sup and converse with them.</p>

<p>Life in the mediæval manor-house, though it
was a life much secluded from the noise and bustle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
of the world, was one full of activity and varied
occupation. There were so many necessary duties
that must be performed, that the absence of entertainment
and of the pleasures of art and literature
was not felt. The horizon was limited. Interests
were concentrated within a narrow compass, but
what is unknown is not missed. For the women
the manor-house was the world. It is recorded as
a merit on the part of Lady Joan Berkeley (mentioned
above), that in the forty-two years of her
married life she never travelled ten miles from
her husband’s houses in Somerset and Gloucester,
“much less humered herselfe with the vaine delightes
of London and other cities.” If a great
lady like the wife of Thomas Lord Berkeley lived
so circumscribed an existence, it is easy to imagine
how small was the circle of women of less degree.
But this limited area of thought and activity does
not seem to have been a bad nursery. Writing of
the fifteenth century, Sir James Ramsay <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If we are led to form an unfavourable opinion of the
male aristocracy of the period, far otherwise is it with
regard to the ladies. Whether as wives, sisters, or daughters,
their letters create most favourable impressions.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In feudal times it was not all noble ladies who
could live in peace and seclusion in their homes, protected
from strife and rude alarms. The châtelaine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
was often called upon to take supreme command
in her lord’s absence, and if trouble arose and
the castle were attacked, the mistress was not only
the nominal but the actual head of affairs. We
do not find in those days that women shut themselves
up and declined to interfere because they did
not understand politics. On the contrary, they
responded to the need with alacrity. The great
lady put down her embroidery-needle and took up
the sword when danger threatened. She did not
fasten herself up in the solarium with her maidens,
but took the command of the household.</p>

<p>A notable heroine in the Wars of the Roses
was Lady Joan Pelham, wife of Sir John Pelham,
Constable of Pevensey Castle. In 1399 Sir John
was in Yorkshire with Henry Duke of Lancaster,
fighting against Richard II. Lady Joan, left in
Pevensey Castle, was fiercely attacked by the
Yorkist forces from Sussex, Kent, and Surrey.
The castle was in great danger, and there was
much difficulty also in obtaining provisions. The
long letter which she wrote to her husband during
the siege has the additional interest of being the
earliest letter extant written by an English lady.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Learned ladies in Saxon times&mdash;Education of women in the Middle
Ages&mdash;The rise of Grammar Schools&mdash;Want of provision for
girls&mdash;Convent schools&mdash;Improvement of education in the fifteenth
century&mdash;Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond, and
her patronage of learning.</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">It</span> might seem superfluous to discuss the subject
of education in periods when reading and writing
were the accomplishments of but a fraction of the
population, while to speak of learning seems altogether
an anomaly. As has already been noted,
writing was a rare accomplishment up to the tenth
century. At the time of the Norman invasion,
there were probably few laymen who could spell
out a breviary. Yet even under the Saxon kings,
when there was such a dearth of knowledge among
the people and a scarcity of all literature, there
was a thread of scholarship running through the
nation among the Monastic Orders. Although the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
foundations of learning had been laid, the building
went on slowly. Strange as it appears, there was
not only among men, but among women, a zest
for study in the far-off days of the Saxon monk
Aldhelm, who wrote for his female pupils his work,
“De Laude Virginitatis.”</p>

<p>Times that were in most respects very unfavourable
for the pursuit of letters produced
students and scholars of no mean capacity. The
seclusion in which monks dwelt by choice and
women by necessity, gave opportunity for studies
that would have been neglected under less rude
conditions. Saxon ladies varied the monotony of
their domestic occupations by the study of Latin,
which they not only read, but wrote with tolerable
fluency.</p>

<p>Latin was then the great vehicle of knowledge.
It was the language of law, the medium of correspondence
between scholars. Most of the accessible
literature was in Latin. It was, therefore, to the
study of that language above all else that students
betook themselves. The learned ladies of the sixteenth
century had their forerunners in the women
of the seventh and eighth, in the studious Abbess
Eadburga and her pupil Leobgitha, with both of
whom the celebrated St. Boniface, called the
Apostle of Germany, corresponded in Latin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
At that period learning was so closely associated
with religion, that the Church was the nursery of
scholars. The acquirements of the Saxon ladies
were due to their connection with the religious
orders. It was in the priories and convents that
the arts of reading and copying manuscripts, of
writing and composition were cultivated. So exclusively
was learning the monopoly of the Church,
that in the Middle Ages the study of books was but
an inconsiderable part of a gentleman’s education.</p>

<p>With women the case was somewhat different.
Their enforced seclusion in days of rude manners
led them to sedentary occupations. They were
frequently the only members of the family who
could read with any ease. As long as war was the
chief business and out-door sports the chief pastime
of men, the quieter lives of the women gave them
the advantage in point of learning.</p>

<p>But with the Renaissance a change crept in.
The education of men began to improve, while that
of the women was left as before. When William
of Wykeham founded his school at Winchester in
1373, he thought only of boys. Henry VI. did
not propose to admit girls to his foundation at
Eton. All the great schools which rose up in the
sixteenth century, Rugby, Harrow, Westminster,
St. Paul’s, and the rest, were confined to the male<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
sex. The universities, though owing much to the
beneficence of women in early times, have, until
recently, not only done nothing for the advancement
of women’s education, but thrown stumbling-blocks
in its way.</p>

<p>In education, as in everything else, the rich, of
course, had the advantage. Sir Nicholas Bacon, in
the reign of Elizabeth, introduced some reforms
into the education of wards. There <span class="locked">were&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“articles devised for the bringing up in vertue and learning
of the Queenes Majesties Wardes, being heires males and
whose landes descending in possession and coming to the
Queenes Majestie shall amount to the cleere yearly value of
c. markes or above.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Girls were put into wardship, too, but the Lord
Keeper does not seem to have thought any reforms
were needed in their education.</p>

<p>It is not surprising to find that the girls of the
poorer classes were often much neglected. A contemporary
writer, speaking of the women of England,
<span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This nevertheless I utterlie mislike in the poorer sort
of them, for the wealthier doo sildome offend herein: that
being of themselves without competent wit they are so
carelesse in the education of their children (wherein their
husbands also are to be blamed) by means whereof verie
manie of them neither fearing God, neither regarding either
manners or obedience, do oftentimes come to confusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
which (if anie correction or discipline had beene used
toward them in youth) might have proved good members
of their common-wealth and countrie by their good service
and industrie.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The children of the poor could not have profited
much by the free education of the convent schools,
for they began to earn their living as soon as they
were able to use their hands. There was plenty of
“discipline” in their bringing up, but not much
regard paid to “manners” or learning.</p>

<p>The custom among the well-to-do classes of
sending their children to live in the houses of the
nobility prevailed all through the Middle Ages and
up to the sixteenth century. Among the laity it
was a recognized mode of education. The kind of
training which the girls, under this system, received
depended on the character and acquirements of the
lady of the house. The primary things to be learnt
were good manners and domestic arts. Books were
very scarce, and, except in religious houses, there
would be few persons who could make use of them.
Even at the end of the fifteenth century it was
unusual for a gentleman to be able to read and write.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
There were, of course, the schools attached to
monasteries and convents where all classes were
taught, and in good families tutors were employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
for both girls and boys, such men as Elmer, Bishop
of London, Roger Ascham, Walter de Biblesworth,
and others notable for learning, acting in that
capacity in the households of the nobility. The
curriculum at the convents included English, Latin,
music, and grammar. The majority of noblemen’s
and gentlemen’s daughters are said to have attended
the convent schools. A custom prevailed for these
young gentlewomen to wear white veils, to distinguish
them from professed nuns, who wore black,
which implies that all the pupils were resident in
the convents. It was not uncommon for the religious
houses to be used as boarding establishments.
At some places ladies were received as
inmates of a conventual household, bringing their
own servants to attend upon them, and to a great
extent living apart from the nuns.</p>

<p>With regard to women’s education, there seem
to have been periods of enlightenment alternating
with periods of darkness. In Saxon days, in the
seventh and eighth centuries especially, the study
of letters occupied a good deal of the attention of
women. But while the Norman and Saxon were
struggling into unity, education everywhere seems
to have been at a low ebb.</p>

<p>Women did not profit much by the literary
renaissance of the age of Chaucer. It is said that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the daughters of John of Gaunt, who was father to
Henry IV., were the first English ladies who could
write (the Saxon abbesses and their pupils are
ignored in this statement), while the earliest letter
extant written by a woman in English is said to
have been the notable epistle, already quoted, sent
by Lady Joan Pelham in 1399 to her husband,
relating her troubles during her gallant defence of
Pevensey Castle.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>By the middle of the fifteenth century, however,
some improvement is noticeable. If writing were
such a rare accomplishment as to add lustre to the
family of John of Gaunt, the grand-daughter of
that illustrious begetter of kings was celebrated
for the keen interest she took in books, and was
herself an author. Margaret Beaufort, mother of
Henry VII., was a noted woman of learning,
though her interest for later generations lies more
in the part she played in history. She was a
woman of great intellectual ability, and had been
most carefully trained. Printing was then a new
art, and the Countess of Richmond, to give her
the title by which she is best known, was a warm
patroness of Caxton’s partner, Wynkyn de Worde,
whom she appointed as her special printer. The
countess was a very great lady, and had her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
printer, her poet, her band of minstrels, just as she
had her resident confessor and her domestic retinue.
She ordered several works to be printed, and did
much to foster a taste for literature among the
ladies of the court.</p>

<p>Her bent of mind was distinctly religious, and
in her later years she regulated her establishment
on monastic lines, and lived a life of conventual
strictness. In her secluded manor-house, situated
in the Hundred of Woking, her principal visitor
was the abbot of the neighbouring monastery of
Newark, who from time to time ambled along the
ill-kept road with a train of monks all mounted
on mules to confer with this powerful but dutiful
daughter of the Church. In the picturesquely
shaded house, which is still well preserved and
retains much of its old-world air, the countess
could pursue her reading and meditations undisturbed,
and it was probably here that she composed
her religious books. Her early studies
enabled her to enjoy such literature as was accessible.
She was well acquainted with Latin and
French, but there is no mention of Greek or
Hebrew.</p>

<p>We must skip the two next generations, and
go on to the great grand-daughters of the Countess
of Richmond before we find the dead languages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
assuming an important place in the curriculum of
a woman’s education. There were very few books
accessible to the laity in the days of Margaret
of Richmond, but she lived long enough to see
the means of knowledge multiplying fast, and to
assist in the process.</p>

<p>The intellectual gifts and literary attainments
of her grandson, Henry VIII., augured well for the
progress of learning in England, and the countess,
who died the year that Henry was crowned, was
thus spared the pain of witnessing the crimes
which stained his after career. The mental energy
which characterised all the Tudors seems to have
had its fountain-head in their distinguished ancestress,
whose position exposed her to many trials
and dangers, through which her strength of mind,
steadiness of purpose, and nobility of character
carried her unscathed. Some ills might have been
averted from England had Margaret Beaufort been
alive during the reign of her grandson. And
what a brilliant leader she would have made of
that group of learned ladies who adorned the
second half of the sixteenth century!</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RISE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES.</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The Feudal System unfavourable to the development of the middle
classes&mdash;Subjection of women under Feudalism&mdash;Tyranny of
feudal lords&mdash;Power of the Church&mdash;Rise of commerce&mdash;Material
progress&mdash;End of the Feudal System.</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">Until</span> the development of England as a manufacturing
country, the strength and importance of
the middle classes were not felt. They came into
power contemporaneously with the growth of trade
and commerce. It was the thriving burgesses who
made England feared by other nations, for it was
they who equipped her fleets and replenished empty
exchequers. It has often been remarked that in
no other country in Europe is there a middle class
corresponding to the middle class in England. In
no other country is the middle class such a powerful
factor in national life. Whether it will retain its
power is doubtful. The blows aimed by socialism
at the upper classes are felt by those below.
For every large landowner who is attacked on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
score of undue wealth, there are a hundred small
property-holders who will bend under the strain put
upon their resources. Ground rents are not all in
the hands of the nobility, and employers of labour
are not all battening on enormous profits. It is the
middle classes whom the socialistic portion of the
democracy wish to reduce to a condition of insecurity,
and whose energies they are trying to
paralyze.</p>

<p>The feudal system was unfavourable to the
growth of the middle classes. It savoured too
much of absolutism. Energy was cramped. Individual
effort was possible only within certain limits.
In the feudal ages people cared more for protection
than for freedom. They bowed to the sovereignty
of the feudal lord, and were dependent on his
bounty. The services which they were obliged to
render prevented them from straying into new
paths, and the conditions under which they lived
made independent action impossible. It was not
until the feudal system was broken down that there
was a free course for the development of the middle
classes. In the first four centuries after the coming
of the Normans, it is the aristocracy who are the
history-makers. Roughly speaking, there are only
two classes to be considered: the nobles and the
serfs&mdash;for such the lower classes remained in all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
important relations of life&mdash;and until the arts of
civilization have made some progress, until the
resources of the country have been brought into
play and foreign commerce has grown into importance,
the life of the populace is a somewhat
monotonous tale.</p>

<p>It has been stated that feudalism raised woman
to a higher place in domestic life; that, whereas
before she was in a state of subjection, under the
feudal system she exercised independent power.
Undoubtedly, as a wife woman was a gainer. The
mantle of authority with which her husband was
invested, fell upon her whenever he was temporarily
absent. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ménage</i> of a feudal household certainly
gave the lady of the house a dignity, and imposed
upon her responsibilities which secured her respect
and gave her freedom of action. She was called
upon to direct a little army of subordinates, and
was her husband’s partner and equal. But this
improvement in the status of women is not discernible,
except in the governing classes. The
women without title, rank, position, wealth, the
women of every-day life, profited little. They shared
in the subjection of their fathers, brothers, and
husbands, and they enjoyed none of the privileges
which the feudal system conferred on their more
highly placed sisters. In a state of society where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the mass of the people were in a dependent
position, it was not likely that any special freedom
would be granted to or even claimed by women.
And in an age when the worship of force was
dominant, their physical inferiority told heavily
against them. Under feudalism there was no sort
of independence possible to women who were
born to wealth or rank.</p>

<p>Women were under a twofold sovereignty&mdash;that
of the feudal lord and of their male relatives.
No woman in any position of life could be said to
be a free agent. If she were a great heiress, she
was disposed of in marriage as best suited the king
and his council without regard to her wishes. In
the case of a vassal’s daughter, the consent of the
feudal lord must be obtained to her marriage.
Every tenant paid a sum of money to the lord on
the marriage of his daughter, and this tax was
even levied in the case of grand-daughters. The
price was fixed by the manorial courts. A couple
could not be betrothed without the permission of
their feudal lord, and if they failed to obtain his
consent they were subject to a fine.</p>

<p>In France, when feudalism was at its height, the
birth of a daughter was regarded as a calamity,
from the sovereign downwards. Louis XI., who
refused even to admit into his presence his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
daughter, Jeanne de Valois, during the first four
years of her life, and ferociously struck at her with
his sword when she chanced one day to come into
view, represents in an exaggerated form the sentiment
of the peasant, who, if he had no sons, would
say, “Je n’ai pas d’enfants, je n’ai que des filles.”</p>

<p>Feudal England did not express herself so
strongly, but a dowerless daughter was felt to be
a heavy burden, and a daughter with a portion was
treated simply as a marketable commodity.</p>

<p>On the labouring classes the tyranny of the
feudal system pressed grievously. A licence had
to be bought to go outside the bounds of the lord
of the manor to obtain work. For instance, an
orphan girl, in the reign of Edward III., paid
sixpence for the privilege of serving and marrying
“wheresoever and whensoever she pleases.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> A
woman living on the estate of a feudal lord was
regarded as, in a manner, his property. If she
married a stranger and left the manor, the lord was
entitled to compensation, as being deprived of part
of his “live stock.”</p>

<p>All through the Middle Ages it was the aim of
the government to keep the people on the land, to
prevent the agricultural population from quitting
the rural districts. No father who could not show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
an income of £20 a year in land or rent might
apprentice his son or daughter to any trade. This
effectually cut off the chances of the majority of the
working class from migrating to the towns. The
system, unworkable as it appears, did not die out
until the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Powerful as was the Church in the Middle Ages,
it was not able to protect women outside the shade
of the cloister. And it will be readily understood
how great was the influence of the priest in an age
when the mass of the people were so little able to
think and judge for themselves; in an age when
belief in the supernatural encompassed daily life
with terrors, when the common laws of nature were
dim mysteries, when disease and misfortune were
ascribed to the malevolence of witches and evil
spirits. The Church was the supreme arbiter, and
to question her decrees was to incur the risk of
eternal misery. The powers of evil could only be
exorcised by holy water and priestly aid, and lapses
into sin were atoned for by substantial offerings. It
was easy to persuade women, always more susceptible
than men to the emotional and imaginative
side of religion, that their dreams and fancies were
divine warnings. In that quaint collection of
fourteenth-century maxims known as the “Book of
the Knight of Latour Landry,” the story is related<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
of a young wife who was induced to desert her
husband for a lover, and fell sick. She had a vision
of a fiery pit, which a priest interpreted to signify
the abode of lost spirits, into which she would have
been plunged but for her piety in supporting one
hundred priests to say masses for the souls of her
parents, and in dispensing charity among the poor.</p>

<p>But if the Church tyrannized over the people
and took advantage of their ignorance, it was a
great uplifting and civilizing power in their lives.
But for the Church the Middle Ages would been
one dark night of un-illumined barbarism. The
Church summed up in herself all that existed of
knowledge and culture. It was the symbol of
order, progress, and learning. In time of war it
was a haven of peace. It was the Church that
enabled women to live secure, sheltered lives in the
midst of turmoils and danger. It was the guardian
of the people’s consciences, and possessed over them
a power of life and death.</p>

<p>Looked at from a lighter side, the Church was
a potent factor in every-day life. Her festivals
were one of the chief recreations of the people. To
women especially, whose diversions were fewer
than those of men, the feast-days, with their processions
and ceremonials, were welcome excitements.
In the services of the Church women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
found an outlet for the gratification of the æsthetic
sense which nothing else afforded. If the main
features of social life in the Middle Ages be
remembered&mdash;the sordidness of the dwellings, the
absence of everything beyond the barest necessaries
in the majority of homes, the lack of indoor recreations,
and of all the resources of modern times
afforded by the means of locomotion&mdash;it will not
appear strange that the Church as a social force
should have wielded such power.</p>

<p>The rise of the middle classes was the rise of
a power antagonistic to the Church. It was the
beginning of the revolt against constituted authority.
It foreshadowed the strife between reason
and dogma. All the movements that have arisen
against the power of the Church have come from
the middle classes. The spirit of inquiry which
led men to question the claims of an infallible
priesthood, and culminated in the breakdown of the
power of the Roman Catholic Church in England,
had its birth among the middle classes. The
modern scientific movement, to which the Anglican
Church has been so bitterly opposed, started from
the same source. The battle for freedom of worship,
whether fought by Anglicans against Romanists,
or by Dissenters against Anglicans, has been mainly
carried on by members of the middle classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
After the fall of feudalism, in the period immediately
preceding the Reformation, the extension
of commerce was raising the middle classes into
power. New paths were opening out, and as
riches were more diffused and intercourse between
different parts of the country and with other
nations became easier, the influence of the Church
was weakened. It became less dominant as new
interests arose.</p>

<p>It was in this period that a remarkable step was
taken among women of the middle class&mdash;a step
which shows that their interest in public affairs was
very keen. A number of city dames drew up a
petition to Parliament and presented it in person.
It was not the stimulus of private interest or the
sharp spur of national calamity that sent them to
the doors of the legislature. It is a significant
fact that it was an affront offered to a woman which
stirred the citizens’ wives to action in the year 1429,
when that unfortunate kinglet, the puppet of his
party, Henry VI., was nominally reigning. The
Duke of Gloucester’s matrimonial concerns were
creating a good deal of agitation. He had put
away his wife, the Countess Jacqueline of Hainault,
daughter of William IV., Count of Holland, and
widow of the Dauphin John, and set in her place
Eleanor Cobham. The good citizenesses were full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
of righteous wrath. They resolved to present a
remonstrance to the House of Lords.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“One Mistress Stokes, with divers other stout women
of London, of good account and well apparelled, came
openly to the Upper House of Parliament and delivered
letters to the Duke of Gloucester, to the Archbishop, and
other lords there present, containing matters of rebuke and
sharp reprehension to the said Duke of Gloucester because
he would not deliver his wife Jacqueline out of her grievous
imprisonment, being then detained prisoner by the Duke of
Burgundy, and suffering her to remain unkindly whilst he
kept another adulteress contrary to the law of God and
the honourable estate of matrimony.”</p></blockquote>

<p>These city dames, who probably were not very
facile with their pen, who had no newspapers to
read, no clubs or societies at which to discuss public
matters, who were, doubtless, much occupied with
the affairs of their household, were so moved by
the iniquity being perpetrated upon one of their
own sex, that they could not forbear taking action.
There must have been much indignant gossip
between good Mistress Stokes and her neighbours.
The outrage on the wifely dignity of Countess
Jacqueline appealed to their inmost feelings. They
were all women of the thriving, comfortable middle
class, as the description implies, “stout women,”
and “well apparelled,” whose husbands would be
citizens of good standing. Or perhaps some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
them were women trading on their own account,
wool-staplers and merchants, as was not uncommon
in those times. They felt, as all good citizenesses
should, that they had part and lot in the affairs of
the kingdom, and did not think it “going out of
their sphere” to express their opinion on a matter
of the gravest import. But it was a bold thing to
interfere in the affairs of a peer of the realm, one
of royal blood, and to go up in person to the
House of Lords, especially for petitioners who by
their rank and connections could not command
special attention, who had neither husbands,
brothers, nor friends in the august assembly to
which they appealed. The personal element, which
was so manifest in the political women of the
eighteenth century, was absent.</p>

<p>With the growth of the commercial movement
and the increase of material prosperity, society was
gradually reconstituted. As feudalism declined, so
did chivalry. The artificial view of life which it
engendered faded away. The commercial instinct,
so strong in the English people, began to override
other impulses.</p>

<p>As England emerged from its commercial insignificance,
an improvement naturally took place
in the material conditions of domestic life. Luxuries
that had hitherto belonged exclusively to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
aristocracy, were introduced into the homes of the
middle classes. Houses were better furnished,
dress became more sumptuous, the table was better
provided. Indeed, the quality of the food was
in advance of the other conditions of life. With
the growth of towns was created a more marked
difference between the rural and urban population.
The burgher’s wife who had glass windows to her
house and went to church in a silken hood, felt
herself on a different plane from the farmer’s wife
with her shuttered lattices and linen coif. The
trading class naturally lived an in-door life, and
became sensitive to hardships endured without
question by the agricultural class. Women who
dwelt in cities fell into a different groove of occupations
and amusements from their rural sisters,
whom they began to regard with some disdain.
Field and farm work were looked upon with a little
scorn by women who had been brought up in the
more sheltered atmosphere of town life. The
dance on the village green and the harvest revels
were superseded for town dwellers by feasts and
shows.</p>

<p>There were hardly any books in the houses even
of prosperous traders, whose literature was confined
to their account-books. As for the women, they
were busy enough with their household affairs, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
sought their recreation in a gossip with their
neighbours. Few of them ever wrote a letter or
found any use for a pen. Even to this day there
are good housewives in country districts who would
be puzzled to make out a receipt or cast up a
column of figures.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century there were few persons
outside the ranks of the clergy who could write.
There was a considerable improvement in the
following century, which affords a convenient
starting-point from which to commence the study
of town life.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Letter-writing was becoming usual
among the well-to-do of the middle classes, those
who would now be called the gentry. Education
was spreading. The gulf between the aristocracy
and the democracy was being bridged over by a
thriving, intelligent middle class. As we approach
the sixteenth century, the old manner of life is fast
seen to be disappearing. The castle is no longer
the power that it was once. The sovereignty of
the nobles is weakened, in many cases completely
shattered, and the system of tyrannical protection
on the one side and slavish dependence on the
other passes away.</p>

<span class="subhead">WOMEN AND THE ANCIENT GILDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">The industrial equality of former days&mdash;Women as members of
Gilds&mdash;Restrictions on trade&mdash;Fitness of girls for industrial
occupations&mdash;Women as watchmakers: Sir John Bennett’s
opinion&mdash;The brewsters and ale-wives&mdash;Trade unions compared

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">The</span> records of the industrial history of England
reveal one anomaly which is by no means cheering
to those who are striving to improve the economic
position of women. It cannot be gainsaid that in
periods before the labour question began to be
scientifically discussed, there was a juster conception
of the relations which should subsist between the
sexes in the common affairs of daily life. Men and
women were treated on a par. When labour laws
were enacted they were enacted for both alike;
it was assumed that the sexes stood on an equality.
With one or two exceptions, there was no especial
legislation for women. Nor was there any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
hindrance, either in theory or in actuality, to
women trading and engaging in industrial occupations.
A woman was not debarred from any
commercial pursuit simply by reason of sex.
Whatever work she was able to undertake she
carried through without having to surmount artificial
barriers set up by prejudice and by the action
of those interested in the restriction of women’s
industrial liberty.</p>

<p>At the present day women have to fight their
way into the commercial world, and every fresh step
which they make towards independence is hailed
as a triumph, and a hopeful sign for the future; or
as a retrograde step, a deplorable and dangerous
departure, according to the views of the onlookers;
but in all cases as something abnormal, to be commented
upon and criticized. The general opinion
in the first half of this century was that women and
business were things apart, and better kept separate.
Either it was assumed that women knew nothing
about business and could never learn, or that if
they did edge their way in they would be thrusting
men out.</p>

<p>It does not appear that in the past such views
were entertained, that women were considered to
be going out of their “sphere” when they entered
the world of trade, or that it was attempted to deny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
them any of the privileges which might attach to
commercial pursuits. The women took their places
quite naturally side by side with the men, and no
one saw anything strange in the position. They
could receive apprentices; they became members
of trade gilds, worked at various industries; in
short, played their part as full members of the industrial
community. It has been remarked that
“great changes in the <em>status</em> of woman and in the
<em>status</em> of labour have been correlative and often
contemporaneous.” This is exemplified in the revolution
brought about by the factory system,
which altered the whole conditions of domestic life
for large numbers of women in the lower ranks.
The greater freedom which women enjoyed in
olden times in regard to trading is remarkable on
account of the severe restrictions applied to all
forms of industry. It was not as if the worker
were left to tread his own path. The relations
between employer and employed were strictly defined.
Hours, wages, clothing, form of engagement,
manner of work, all came under legal supervision.
And yet this interfering legislation did not create
those differences between male and female adult
workers, which have been a deplorable feature of
modern times, and which faddists of a certain
school are doing their best to accentuate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
It may be argued that women have perfect
liberty in the present day to enter upon any commercial
pursuit; that the law does not hinder
them from becoming merchants, shipowners, and
traders of all kinds. What the law, however, does
not forbid, custom prevents. Among the middle
classes it is tacitly agreed that the boys of the
family must be started on a commercial career, and
systematic efforts are being made towards achieving
that end. A boy is apprenticed to some trade, and
shown how to work his way up step by step from
the bottom rung to the top of the ladder. He can
enter a manufactory, a workshop, a retail business.
But want of training and want of capital have
militated against the industrial progress of women.
There are only a few trades open to a girl, not for
lack of physical strength, but because custom has
decreed that certain occupations shall belong to
men. Putting aside such pursuits as are obviously
unsuited to girls&mdash;for in dealing with female labour
it is the fitness of <em>girls</em> that has to be considered,
since all occupations must be entered upon before
adult life&mdash;there are many employments in which
they are as well, if not better, fitted to engage than
men and boys.</p>

<p>Sir John Bennett, writing in 1857, called attention
to the fact that women were excellent watchmakers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
and might be profitably employed in England as
they were on the Continent.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Thousands of women are at this moment finding
profitable employment at the most delicate portion of
watch-work throughout the district around Neuchatel. The
subdivision of labour is there wisely made so minute as to
adjust itself precisely to the special capabilities of every
woman’s individual dexterity. The watch is composed of
many distinct parts; some require force and decision in
the hands of the workman, while many are so exquisitely
delicate that for them the fine touch of the female finger is
found to be far superior to the more clumsy handling of
the man.... Now, why should not our English women be
employed upon a labour for which their sisters in Switzerland
prove themselves so eminently adapted, and thus
provide, to a large extent, a remedy for the distresses of
our labouring population, and open out a new channel
whereby they may elevate their condition and benefit
mankind? In London 50,000 females are working under
sixpence per day, and above 100,000 under one shilling per
day. So long as nearly every remunerative employment
is engrossed by men only, so long must the wretchedness
and slavery of women remain what it is. For any man to
declare, whatever his motive, that the women of London
are sure to do badly what the Swiss women are now doing
well, is an insult and a fallacy in which I refuse to join.</p>

<p>“No factory system is necessary for the successful
manufacture of this very beautiful little machine. The
father has but to teach his own daughters, wife, and female
relatives at his own home, and then, just as their leisure
suits, they can perform each her part without necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
interfering with the most indispensable of her domestic
duties. Thus the whole family is well provided for, and
by the reduction of the cost of the watch, the sale would
be increased indefinitely, and this increase would give
additional employment to men and women in about equal
proportion. Working watchmakers have no need to fear
the introduction of female labour; the large demand that
necessarily would ensue, when watches were materially
cheapened in price, would doubtless more than compensate
any loss they might temporarily sustain; the
change it would effect would be found not only a moral
good and an immense social blessing, but would satisfy
the indispensable requirements of a strong commercial
necessity.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When people complain of women pushing into
men’s occupations, it ought to be remembered how
many things men have absorbed which formerly
belonged as much, if not more, to women. For
instance, it was the women who did the brewing,
even in households where men were employed for
other domestic duties. The feminine suffix in the
word “brewster” is another sign that brewing was a
woman’s occupation. Most of the beer-houses in
London were owned by women who brewed their
own beer up to the end of the fifteenth century,
by which time brewing was passing into the hands
of men. Women were also the principal ale-keepers,
and the ale-wife was a noted character in
rural England. The number of inns kept at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
present day by women, in the country districts
especially, shows how this old custom has held its
ground.</p>

<p>An ordinance of Edward III. indicates the kind
of trades in which formerly women were predominant.
It <span class="locked">runs&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“But the intent of the King and his Council is that
women, that is to say, brewers, bakers, carders and
spinners, and workers as well of wool as of linen cloth and
of silk; brawdesters, and breakers of wool, and all other
that do use and work all handy works, may freely use and
work as they have done before this time without any
impeachment or being restrained by this ordinance.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In former times it was not felt to be unseemly
for men and women to work side by side, nor are
there any evidences that such a proceeding led to
immoral conduct. Then it was habitual for the
sexes to be associated in labour. The situation
presented nothing strange, and nothing tempting;
custom proved a safeguard. In spite of the improvement
in manners and public conduct, the
difficulty of men and women consorting for a common
purpose has always been put forth in modern times
as a reason why certain occupations should be
restricted to men, except among the lower class of
operatives who are continually under the eye of
overseers, and in shops where the public act as
supervisors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
There are certain departments of industry
which bring out very clearly the advantages which
women formerly possessed and the privileges they
enjoyed. It is claimed, though on insufficient
grounds, that the present trade unions are the
legitimate descendants of the ancient gilds. In one
respect, certainly, they are extremely unlike. The
trade unions have, until quite recently, been purely
men’s associations, and their formation has been
a hindrance to the women working in the same
trade. The gilds knew no distinctions of sex.
They were formed in the interest of the trading
community for purposes of mutual help, and were
as much for the benefit of the “sisteren” as the
“bretheren.” The attitude of the ancient gilds
towards women was essentially different from that
of the modern trade unions.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the influence of the gilds
was considerable. Their authority was widespread,
and they practically controlled the trade. It is,
therefore, of importance to note their action and
the rules by which they were constituted when considering
the position of women in regard to industry
and commerce. In nearly all the gilds there were
women members, and in many cases the names of
women appear as founders. Gilds were formed
for various purposes. They were in the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
friendly societies. In addition to their commercial
side, they were “associations for mutual help and
social and religious intercourse amongst the people,”
and these associations “were almost always formed
equally of men and women.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>Miss Toulmin Smith says, in her Introduction to
“English Gilds,” <span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“scarcely five out of the five hundred were not formed
equally of men and women.... Even where the affairs
were managed by a company of priests, women were
admitted as lay members, and they had many of the same
duties and claims upon the gilds as the men.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The brothers and sisters all met together to
transact the business of the gild. It was no mere
matter of form to admit women. They were active
working members, sharing in all the privileges and
contributing to the funds, though smaller payments
were sometimes exacted of the women. The female
members, like the male, wore the livery.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Also it is ordeyned that every suster of the fraternite
and Gilde schul ben cladde in a swte of hodes, that is for to
seye reed, pena 20<sup>d</sup>.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Not only did the gild lend money to the younger
members to start them in business, and succour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
those in distress who “fell into poverty through
mishap, and not by fault of their own,” but it provided
the dowerless with marriage portions, or the
penniless with means to embrace a religious life.
In the ordinances of the Ludlow Gild, established
in 1824, was a clause <span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“if any good girl of the gild of marriageable age cannot
have the means found by her father either to go into a
religious house or to marry, whichever she wishes to do;
friendly and right help shall be given her, out of our means
and our common chest, enabling her to do whichever of
the two she wishes.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In the religious gilds, of which there were two
classes, one for the clergy and one for the laity, the
women were put on a par with the lay members.
Any gross offence, such as drinking and rioting,
committed by a priest, was punished with degradation;
but if the offender were a layman or a
woman, by exclusion until satisfaction was given.
The clergy gilds did not admit women as members,
but in one of the foreign gilds the wives of lay
brothers were admitted on certain conditions at the
oft-repeated request of the members.</p>

<p>The great companies also admitted women. The
female members of the Drapers’ Company carried
on business and received apprentices like the male
members. “Every brother or sister of the fellowship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
taking an apprentice shall present him to the
wardens, and shall pay 1¾,” runs the ordinance of
1503. This company was very careful to enjoin
respect for its female members. It was expressly
ordered that when a “sister” died she should be
interred with full honours, have the best pall thrown
over her coffin, and be “followed by the Fraternity
to the grave with every respectful ceremony equally
as the men.” After the death of a gild brother, his
widow could carry on his trade as one of the gild.
If a female member married a man of the same
trade who was not free of the gild, he acquired
freedom by the marriage. A woman who married
a man of another trade was excluded from the gild.
There were certain gilds of which women became
free in their own right, and others where the wives
and daughters of the gild brothers acquired a right
to membership from their connection. In the craft
gilds a member was allowed to have his wife and
children and maid-servant to assist him in his work.
The Clothworkers, the Fishmongers, the Grocers,
all speak in their articles of brothers and sisters.
Wives of members of the Grocers’ Company were
admitted on their marriage.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“All women not of the Fraternity and after married to
any of the Fraternity shall be entered and looked upon as
of the Fraternity for ever, and shall be assisted and made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
as one of us; and after the death of the husband, the
widow shall come to the dinner and pay 40<sup>d</sup>. if she
is able.”</p></blockquote>

<p>If she married out of the fraternity, she was
not to be admitted to the feast, or to receive any
assistance from the company. Within recent times
women have obtained the freedom of both the
Fishmongers’ and the Drapers’ Companies, but for
the purpose of sharing in the charities, not with a
view to trading. Since the beginning of the present
century forty-two women have been admitted to the
Drapers’ Company, and there are now upwards of
a hundred belonging to the Fishmongers’ Company.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Formerly married women were merchants and
traders on their own account. Clearly, it was by
no means unusual, for in the <cite>Liber Albus of London</cite>,
compiled in the fourteenth century, is an ordinance
relating to married women carrying on business
<span class="locked">alone&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“and where a woman <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coverte de baron</i> follows craft within
the said city by herself apart, with which the husband in
no way intermeddles, such woman shall be bound as a
single woman as to all that concerns her said craft. And
if the husband and wife are impleaded in such case, the
wife shall plead as a single woman in the Court of Record,
and shall have her law and other advantages by way of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
plea just as a single woman. And if she is condemned
she shall be committed to prison until she shall have made
satisfaction; and neither the husband nor his goods shall
in such case be charged or interfered with.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was recognized that wives were independent
beings responsible for their own acts. This is
clearly shown by the following ordinance in the
<cite>Liber Albus:</cite>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Item, if a wife, though a single woman, rents any
house or shop within the said city, she shall be bound to
pay the rent of the said house or shop, and shall be
impleaded and sued as a single woman, by way of debt if
necessary, notwithstanding that she was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coverte de baron</i> at
the time of such letting, supposing that the lessor did not
know thereof.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There was no exemption for women on the
ground of sex. An enactment in the Statute of
Labourers passed in the reign of Edward III. for
preventing idleness expressly includes women. It
provides <span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“every man and woman of our realm of England of what
condition he be, free or bond, able in body and within the
age of threescore years, not living in merchandize, not
exercising any craft, nor having of his own whereof he
may live, nor proper land about whose tillage he may
himself occupy, and not serving any other, if he in convenient
service (his estate considered) be required to serve,
he shall be bounden to serve him which so shall him
require.... And if any such man or woman being so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
required to serve will not the same do, ... he shall be
committed to the next gaol, there to remain under strait
keeping, till he find surety to serve in the form aforesaid.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When an oppressive enactment was made regulating
the wages of labourers and prohibiting them
from receiving anything beyond a certain sum,
women were included. Their movements also were
controlled. In the reign of Richard II. it was
<span class="locked">provided&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“that no artificer, labourer, servant nor victualler, man nor
woman, should travel out of the hundred, rape, or wapen-take
where he is dwelling without a letter patent under
the King’s seal, stating why he is wandering, and that the
term for which he or she had been hired has been completed.
Otherwise the offender might be put in a pair of
stocks, which was to be provided in every town.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Another curiously arbitrary regulation ordained
that if a girl or boy served up to the age of twelve
at husbandry, they were to continue that employment
all their lives, and not to turn to any craft. “Up to
the age of twelve” is a significant sign of the
conditions of juvenile life. Children were held as
full members of the working population.</p>

<p>It is evident that in the eye of the law women
ranked on an equality with men. Narrow as was
the view taken by legislators of industrial life, and
absurd as many of the enactments seem now, it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
reserved for modern times to set up an artificial
barrier between the sexes, to push the working
woman down a step, and rank her with children
and “young persons.”</p>

<p>The sense of the community was in advance of
the legal conception which merged the personality
of the wife in that of the husband. The gilds took
care, by special ordinances, to remedy the defects
of the law. Having admitted women to the full
privileges of their order, and regarding them as
workers with individual rights and duties, they
naturally reasoned that women should not be
exempted from the responsibilities of their own
acts because they were married. In the ordinances
of the Worcester Gild, founded 1467, is the <span class="locked">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Also yf eny man’s wyf becom detto^r or plegge, or by
or sylle eny chaffare or vitelle, or hyn eny house by har
lyf, she to answere to hym or hur that hath cause to sue,
as a woman soole marchaunt; and that an acion of dette
be mayntend agenst hur, to be conceyved aft<sup>r</sup> the custom
of the seid lite, w<sup>t</sup>out nemyng her husband in the seid
accyon.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It has been pointed out that under the gild
system women were employed to a much smaller
extent in manufactures than under the domestic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
system which followed.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> An ordinance of the
fullers of Lincoln places a restriction on the indiscriminate
employment of women, and limits it to
the wives and servants of the masters. Whatever
their position in the lower branches of trade, they
had full access to the higher departments. They
had governing power and the privileges which
belong to members of corporate bodies. The
changes that followed on the break-up of the gilds
tended to throw women into the rank and file of
workers and to exclude them from the more responsible
posts.</p>

<p>The principle of equality is everywhere apparent
in the ordinances relating to labour. In the reign
of Edward IV. an ordinance was made in the
borough of Wells, that apprentices of both sexes
to burgesses would become burgesses themselves
when their term of service was accomplished. No
distinction was made between male and female.
Statutes relating to apprentices in London and
elsewhere apply equally to both girls and boys.
It was taken as a matter of course that a parent
might wish to apprentice his daughter just as much
as his son. The proclamation in 1271, relating to
the woollen industry, expressly permitted “all
workers of woollen cloths, male and female, as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
of Flanders as of other lands,” to come to England
to follow their craft. Sometimes, indeed, the
women appear to have enjoyed an advantage, as
in the statute of 1363 which ordered that “handicraftsmen
should use but one mystery,” while workwomen
were free to work in their accustomed
way. In later times a theory grew up that women
were competitors, not co-workers, with men. There
are numbers of people who on this ground would
hinder women from engaging in commercial pursuits
and earning their own livelihood. They argue that
it is better for women to be dependent upon their
male relatives than to make their own way in the
world. That women should seek to achieve
economic independence was, until recently, quite
against the general sentiment. But the force of
circumstances has proved stronger than theories:
a surplus female population and changes in social
life have upset the notion that women were created
solely for family life, and that they were to be the
spenders, not the providers.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MEDIÆVAL NUN.</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Dominance of the Church in the Middle Ages&mdash;The Conventual
System&mdash;Occupations of the Nuns&mdash;Power of the Abbesses&mdash;Disputes
between Religious Houses and the Laity&mdash;Latitude
allowed to Nuns&mdash;Convents Educational Centres&mdash;Effects of the
Suppression of Convents&mdash;Complaints of the Laity.</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">Throughout</span> the Middle Ages the Church was the
dominant power in England. It may seem absurd
to characterize a period extending over several
centuries by any one feature, but the supremacy
of the Church is so marked as to stamp the whole
of that changeful time. The relationship of the
Church to the laity was that of guardian and ruler,
in temporal as well as spiritual matters. Where
the Church did not inspire reverence it inspired
fear, and where there was not willing obedience
there was dependence.</p>

<p>The position of women with regard to the Church
was affected by this attitude of the Church to the
world. As servants of this mighty organization,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
women who embraced a religious life were lifted
by the Church’s power and influence above the
heads of the rest of the community, of whom they
were frequently the teachers, helpers, advisers, and
general benefactors in time of need. It was in
the nunneries that the education of girls of all
classes was carried on. Convent schools were
the only schools either for rich or poor, and the
“sisters” the only women able to qualify themselves
to become instructors.</p>

<p>The nuns, again, were the chief dispensers of
charity. The lady of the manor might be a
bountiful almsgiver, but she could not be so well
acquainted with the needs of the poor as the
convent sisters who tended them in sickness and
knew all the troubles of their daily life. The
convent was a centre of help and enlightenment.
Even where the nuns never left their walls, they
were constantly employed on benevolent works.
Philanthropy, in the Middle Ages, was a religious
duty, but it was only in connection with the Church
that it was practised in an organized way. The
dole-giving at great houses was scarcely philanthropy;
it was part of the household system, and
the recipients of the bounty regarded it almost as
a right.</p>

<p>Women’s position in relation to the Church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
assumes a different aspect when the limitations of
ordinary life are considered. There was no social
work in which women could engage carried on
independently of the Church. The “religious” had
the field to themselves. The lay worker was of no
importance whatever unless she had wealth which
enabled her to confer benefits, or dignities which
gave her prominence. Through the convent the
Church’s influence was diffused among the people,
its doctrines leavened the minds of the masses, its
authority and power were felt everywhere among
high and low.</p>

<p>Their relation to the Church elevated women to
a plane above the common level. For although
they were in subjection to their spiritual rulers,
those rulers had authority far greater in civil
matters than their successors can boast of in the
present day. The humble nun who went about
with downcast eyes, who was taught to obey without
questioning, was the instrument of a power
greater than that of kings. In the progress of
civilization, it was women who, through the Church,
gained the firstfruits of culture.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, and, indeed, as long as the
conventual system lasted as part of the English
Church, the nun was teacher, philanthropist, doctor,
and nurse. Her duties were by no means confined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
to the cloister. At Gloucester, where there was
a Benedictine convent, the nuns went about
among the people, teaching, advising, consoling, and
discoursing on subjects with which convent sisters
are supposed to have little acquaintance. Nuns
were sometimes accused of giving too much attention
to housewifery. Among other things, they are
said to have composed moral tales like those of
Hannah More and her sisters, and to have read
them to the village maidens.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The English nuns,” writes Paul Casenigo, a Venetian
traveller of the sixteenth century, “gave instruction to the
poorer virgins (peasants) as to their duties when they
became wives; to be obedient to their husbands, and to
give good example.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The poorer folk felt it a great loss when the
kindly sisters&mdash;many of them gentlewomen of good
birth&mdash;to whom they were accustomed to carry all
their troubles, were ruthlessly dispersed at the time
of the dissolution of the religious houses. The
nunnery of Godstow, near Oxford, famous for its
unblemished reputation, was quite a centre of
benevolence. There were no clothing clubs in that
or any other neighbourhood, no “mothers’ meetings,”
no sewing-parties for making garments for
the poor, no penny dinners, no dispensaries, no
hospitals. If it had not been for the good nuns of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Godstow, the poor must have suffered greatly.
Henri Ambère, a French architect, says of Godstow,
that he saw no such excellent nuns in his own
country as were to be seen in that convent. Warm
clothing was made for the poor, who, in winter,
had to bar out the light to keep out the cold by
means of shutters, and whose chimney consisted of
a simple hole in the roof through which the rain
and wind poured down, while the smoke struggled
up ineffectually. Were there any sick? it was the
nuns to whom application was made for remedies,
which were compounded within the convent walls.
Were there any infirm and starving? there was
food for them at the convent. Was there a wedding
in the village? it was the nuns who provided the
bride with her simple trousseau. Every year
provision was made to give a couple of suits of
clothing and the sum of ten shillings to six peasant
girls on their marriage.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Thus we find the nuns carrying on, as part of
their service to the Church, all kinds of secular
work, now largely performed by lay members of
the community.</p>

<p>With the fall of the monastic houses much of
this work was dropped. The Anglican Church,
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
no such hold on the people at large as the Romish
Church had acquired. As an organization for
dealing with the masses, it was particularly ineffective.
In this century the Church has regained
something of what it lost, or rather it has
covered ground which it had never before really
occupied. One of the most striking features of its
remarkable activity at the present day is the large
part taken by women. Without the service of
women, the Church would be unable to carry on
the greater portion of its secular work. But there
is a noticeable difference between the way in which
the work is undertaken in the present age and in
what are called the Ages of Faith. That which is
now accomplished by co-operation among individuals,
without reference to any authority, was
formerly only practicable under the ægis of the
Church. Women could never have performed that
kind of ministry to the community without the
help of the Church. It was in the convent they
obtained the qualification and the means, and it
was the convent garb that protected them in the
discharge of their outside duties.</p>

<p>There is another aspect in which women’s
relation to the Church may be studied. The heads
of the great religious houses were necessarily
persons of importance, with privileges and great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
responsibilities. They had considerable wealth
at their disposal, and in authority and influence
they ranked among the nobles of the land, to whom
they were often allied by birth. An abbess was
a person to be reckoned with and consulted as
much as an abbot. In the age of double monasteries
she was superior in power. The origin of these
institutions is a little obscure. It has been thought
that the idea was derived from Gaul, whither the
Saxon princesses were sent to be educated. Dr.
Lingard has another theory. He considers the
double monasteries were formed to prevent the
nuns from having any excuse for intercourse with
laymen. A convent could not be worked entirely
by women; prejudice and tradition, as well as the
limitations of sex, stood in the way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The functions of the sacred ministry had always been
the exclusive privilege of the men, and they alone were
able to support the fatigues of husbandry and conduct the
extensive estates which many convents had received from
the piety of their benefactors.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Men were necessary evils; the question was how
to make their presence innocuous.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It was conceived that the difficulty might be diminished
if it could not be removed, and with this view some
monastic legislators devised the plan of establishing double
monasteries. In the vicinity of the edifice destined to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
receive the virgins who had dedicated their chastity to
God, was erected a building for the residence of a society
of monks or canons, whose duty it was to officiate at the
altar and superintend the external ceremony of the community.
The mortified and religious life to which they
had bound themselves by the most solemn engagements
was supposed to render them superior to temptation; and,
to remove even the suspicion of evil, they were strictly
forbidden to enter the inclosure of the women, except on
particular occasions, with the permission of the superior,
and in the presence of witnesses. But the abbess retained
the supreme controul over the monks as well as the nuns;
their prior depended on her choice, and was bound to
regulate his conduct by her instructions.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Double monasteries were very common in
Ireland, and were in vogue in England during the
first eight or nine centuries of the Christian era.
Over these institutions it was always a woman who
had supreme rule. No abbot could be persuaded
to take charge of a community of nuns, so the
abbess ruled over both monks and nuns.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The whole together formed a sort of vast family,
maternity being the natural form of authority&mdash;all the
more so as the neophytes were often admitted with all
their dependents, as was Cædmon, who entered Whitby
with all belonging to him, including a child of three years
old.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Abbesses were great people in Saxon times&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>princesses
of royal blood, like St. Hilda, who was
grand-niece to Edwin, the first Christian king of
Northumbria. St. Ethelburga, who also lived in
the seventh century, and became abbess of Brie,
in the diocese of Meaux, was the daughter of a
king of East Anglia; St. Ethelreda, who built
Ely monastery, was a queen, and the daughter of
a king; St. Werburga of Ely was the daughter
of Wulfere, king of Mercia, and niece of Ethelred,
who put her to rule over all the female religious
houses. With her royal uncle’s aid, she founded
Trentham and Hanbury in Staffordshire, and
Wedon in Northamptonshire. There were great
solemnities when she became a nun and entered
the Abbey of Ely, of which St. Audry was then
the head. Her qualities and character were celebrated
in the following <span class="locked">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>For an abbess the cloister rule was relaxed.
She might come and go, and see whom she pleased.
Her signature is to be found to the charters of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the realm, and she had the right to assist in the
deliberations of the national assemblies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In 694 abbesses were in so great esteem for their
sanctity and prudence, that they were summoned to the
Council at Becanceld (in Kent), and the names of five
(not one abbot) subscribed to the constitutions there made.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the first time they are mentioned as
taking part in a synod. The Abbess Elfleda was
present at a council held respecting the affairs of
Wilfrid, Bishop of Leicester, early in the eighth
century. She attended to represent her late
brother, King Alcfrid, who died in 705, and who,
in the matter of Bishop Wilfrid, had, she asserted,
promised, on his death-bed, to stand by the decree
of the Apostolic See.</p>

<p>Abbesses were also summoned to attend or to
send proxies to the King’s Council in later times,
as in 1306, when four abbesses</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“were cited to the Great Council held to grant an aid
on the knighting of the Prince of Wales&mdash;an assembly
which, although not properly constituted, exercised some
of the functions of a parliament.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The Parliamentary writ bears the names of the
abbesses of Wilton, Wynton or Winchester, Shaftesbury,
and Barking, then spelt Berkeyngg. Abbesses
were required to furnish military service by proxy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
The Saxon abbesses were invested with immense
powers, and owed obedience to none save
the Pope. Much of the deference paid them was
doubtless on account of their high rank, abbesses
being always of good birth, and frequently of royal
blood. In later times, as well as in the Saxon era,
this was the case. Anne, Duchess of York, mother
of Edward IV., was prioress of Sion monastery.</p>

<p>Abbesses seem to have been tenacious of their
privileges, and to have known how to resist the
encroachments of the clergy when any interference
was attempted. It has been said that they claimed
the right to ordain. At the same time, they were
subject to deposition if they abused their power
or were inattentive to their duties. The nuns
would carry their complaints to the bishop, who
would occasionally take the superintendence of a
nunnery into his own hands instead of appointing
any abbess&mdash;perhaps dividing the immediate governance
between two of the nuns. It was the
duty of an abbess not only to look after the
internal affairs of the convent, but to see that
the necessary repairs to the building were carried
out.</p>

<p>The powers of an abbess varied according to
period and place, for while in some cases they were
free to act pretty much as they pleased, in others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
they were subject to strict rules, and had their
liberty much curtailed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“By a council near Paris, in the eighth century, it is
ordered that the bishop, as well as the abbess, may send
a nun misbehaving herself to a penitentiary; that no
abbess is to superintend more than one monastery, or to
quit the precincts except once a year, when summoned
by her sovereign; and that the abbess must do penance
in the monastery for her faults by the bishop’s direction.
Charlemagne enacted that the bishop must report to the
Crown any abbess guilty of misconduct, in order that she
might be deposed. Abbesses were forbidden, in the reign
of his successor, to walk alone, and thus were placed, in
some degree, under the surveillance of the sisterhood.
Charlemagne prohibited abbesses from laying hands on
any one, or pronouncing the blessing.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On account of the property and lands belonging
to convents, abbesses and prioresses were constantly
brought into relationship with the outer world, and
not always in a very pleasant way. The command
which they had over the fiefs of the convent was
a frequent source of friction with the laity. In
1292 the Prioress of Mynchin Buckland, in Somersetshire,
was a party in a suit, together with a
widow and two men, touching the right of common
pasture in an appurtenance of the convent. The
case went against the religious house, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
prioress and the widow both escaped paying their
share of the costs on the plea of poverty.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Sometimes troubles arose from the interference
of the clergy. In the fourteenth century a diocesan
official made himself very disagreeable to the
sisters of Mynchin Buckland priory, demanding
to see their title to certain churches which they
had held from time immemorial. The sisters
replied by demanding, in their turn, to see his
commission, whereupon he grew indignant, and
imposed upon them a heavy fine for contumacy.
The case was carried to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
who at once stopped the proceedings of the
diocesan official, and restored quietude to the
convent.</p>

<p>In the reign of Edward III. we find a prioress
suing a sheriff for recovery of a pension granted to
her convent in the reign of Henry III. As the
sheriff positively refused to pay, the prioress carried
the case to the King’s Court, where the recalcitrant
sheriff was thoroughly beaten. Lands granted to
a convent without due formalities sometimes created
difficulties, as in the reign of Henry IV., when the
Prioress of Mynchin Barrow found her claim to a
meadow which had been granted without the royal
licence was bringing her into conflict with the laity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
However, her rights were maintained after full
examination.</p>

<p>The head of a religious house, whether abbot or
abbess, had a great many secular duties. At Sion
Monastery, which was a double house founded by
Henry V. in 1415, the abbess who was at the head
had the charge of all the money derived from the
proceeds of the nuns’ work, and also from the
endowments of the foundation. In the charter it
is set <span class="locked">forth&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“that the abbess of the aforesaid place and her successors
shall be persons able to prosecute all manner of causes and
actions real and personal and mixed, of whatsoever nature
or kind they may be, and to answer and defend the same
as well in courts spiritual as temporal, before all judges,
ecclesiastical and secular whatsoever.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There was very often a certain amount of Church
patronage connected with a religious house. The
Prioress of Cannyngton Priory had the living of a
church in the diocese of Exeter in her hands, and
frequently ecclesiastics were admitted to Holy
Orders on titles granted by a prioress and her
convent.</p>

<p>Mynchin Buckland, which was a preceptory as
well as a priory, was disturbed in 1270 by the
conduct of the preceptor, who did not like to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
any money paid for the maintenance of the sisterhood.
This was the only community of women
established by the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Nunneries were generally under the superintendence
of the local clergy, who were responsible
to the bishop, and if there were any disorders, an
official was sent down to inquire into the matter.
The diocesan officials had large powers, and used
them liberally.</p>

<p>Another thing which brought the convent into
relationship with the outer world, was the fact of
their being used as houses of entertainment, and as
places of residence for ladies temporarily in want of
a home.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Visitors were constantly sent by the
bishop to lodge and board at a priory. These
ladies always lived at their own cost, and it was
specially enjoined that they were not to interfere
with the routine of the establishment. They brought
their own servants, and sometimes remained a considerable
time. These visitors never came without
an express order from the bishop.</p>

<p>The kind of accommodation to be found in a
priory may be gathered from the following inventory
of the contents of a chamber allotted to one “Dame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Agnes Browne” in the priory of Minster, in
Sheppey.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Stuff given her by her frends:&mdash;A fetherbed, a bolster,
2 pyllows, a payre of blankatts, 2 corse coverleds, 4 pare
of shets good and badde, an olde tester and selar of paynted
clothes and 2 peces of hangyng to the same; a square cofer
carvyd, with 2 bed clothes upon the cofer, and in the
wyndow a lytill cobard of waynscott carvyd and 2 lytill
chestes; a small goblet with a cover of sylver parcell gylt,
a lytill maser with a brynne of sylver and gylt, a lytell pese
of sylver and a spore of sylver, 2 lytyll latyn candellstyks,
a fire panne and a pare of tonges, 2 small aundyrons, 4
pewter dysshes, a porrenger, a pewter bason, 2 skyllotts
[a small pot with a long handle], a lytill brasse pot, a
cawdyron and a drynkyng pot of pewter.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There were occasions when the lady abbess
dispensed hospitality on a liberal scale. At the
convent of Sion, in London, it was the custom at
Pardon-time, which was in the month of August,
for the Court of Aldermen to pay a visit to the
convent.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> It will easily be imagined that a good
deal of preparation had to be made for these visitors.
They recognized the demands made upon their
hostess by sending the appropriate acknowledgment
of a present of wine.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages nuns were allowed, under
regulations, to go out and see their friends. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
rule was stricter in earlier periods, and strictest of
all among the double monasteries. In the first six
centuries of the Christian Church, the general rule
seems to have been <span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“a virgin was not permitted to leave the house or monastery
except for special reason, and no one had access to her
but bishop or priest.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">But this was subject to variation, for in the Roman
Church, about the fourth century, we read of “holy
virgins” frequenting the public baths, for which
they were blamed by Cyprian. A male or female
devotee could, at any time, return to the world and
marry.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The injunctions made in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries show that a great deal of
latitude was permitted to nuns. It was not until
the sixteenth century that they were rigidly confined
to the cloister.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> In the Middle Ages they were
not much more under restraint, in the matter of
visiting, than girls in boarding-schools and colleges
at the present day. They were not to go out
without express permission, or to wander from
house to house when they went into the neighbouring
city. Sometimes it was enjoined that they
should only go to places from which they could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
return the same day, and at other convents they were
permitted to remain out one night. In one case
they were not to go “beyond the vill except from
great and lawful cause; in pairs and in nun’s habit.”</p>

<p>The Superior of the convent of St. Helen’s,
London, was admonished to be circumspect, and
not to let women have the keys of the postern door,
“for there is moche comyng in and oute at unlefull
tymys.” That there should be any coming and
going of this promiscuous kind shows how much
latitude was allowed in religious houses.</p>

<p>Anchoresses were under stricter rules, and had
less to do with the outer world.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“An anchoress must not become a schoolmistress, nor
turn her anchoress-house into a school for children. Her
maiden may, however, teach any little girl concerning
whom it might be doubted whether she should learn
among boys, but an anchoress ought to give her thoughts
to God only.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The directions to the women attending on the
anchoresses show how in the thirteenth century,
when these rules were framed, personal cleanliness
was still regarded as among the errors to be avoided,
or at least a luxury to be renounced.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Let no man see them unveiled, nor without hood.
Let them look low. They ought not to kiss, nor lovingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
embrace any man, neither of their acquaintance nor a
stranger, <em>nor to wash their head</em>, nor to look fixedly on
any man, nor to romp nor frolic with him.”</p></blockquote>

<p>But the anchoresses themselves have permission
to wash “whensoever it is necessary, as often as ye
please.” They were enjoined to occupy themselves
with useful and charitable work. “Assist with your
own labour, as far as ye are able, to clothe yourselves
and your domestics as St. Jerome teacheth.”</p>

<p>In 1534 the Archbishop of York wrote, among
other things, the following injunction to the convent
of <span class="locked">Synningthwaite:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We enjoin and command by these presents that
from henceforth the prioress shall diligently provide that
no secular nor religious persons have resort or recourse at
any time to her or any of the said sisters on any occasion,
unless it be their fathers and mothers or other near
kinsfolk.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Also&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We command and exhort the said prioress in
virtue of obedience that she from henceforth license none
of her sisters to go forth of the house unless it be for the
profit of the house, or to visit their fathers and mothers
or other their near kinsfolk, if the prioress shall think it
convenient, and then the prioress shall assign some sad
and discreet religious sister to go with her, and that she
limit them a time to return, and that they be not over long
out of the monastery.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
The nuns were accustomed to indulge in amusements,
for there are injunctions which show that
games and revels were common.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Also we enjoyne you that alle daunsyng and revelyng
be utterly forborne among you except Christmasse and
other honest tymys of recreacyone, among yourse selfe in
absence of seculars in all wyse.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The nuns of Appleton, Yorkshire, were apparently
rather jovial, and the prioress is commanded
in 1489 to see “that none of your sisters
use the alehouse nor the watersyde where course of
strangers dayly resorte.” It was likewise ordered
that the sisters should <span class="locked">not&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“bring in, receave, or take any layman religious or secular
into the chambre or any secrete place day or night, nor
with thaim in such private places to commine, ete or
drinke, without lycence of your priorisse.”</p></blockquote>

<p>At Sion Monastery the rule was stricter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Conversation with seculars was permitted only in
company and with the license of the abbess from noon to
vespers, and this only on Sundays, and the great feasts
of the Saints, not however by going out of the house, but
by sitting at the appointed windows; for to none was it
permitted after their entrance to leave the cloisters of the
monastery. If any sister desired to be seen by her parents
or honest and dear friends, she might, with the permission
of the abbess, open the window occasionally during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
year; but if she did not open it, a more abundant reward
was assured to her hereafter.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This monastery is described by Wriothesley as
“the vertues [most virtuous] house of religion that
was in England.” Taine speaks of it in very
different terms: “Au monastère de Sion les moines
confesseurs des nonnes les debauchent et les
absolvent tout ensemble.” Sion Monastery was of
the Order of St. Bridget which was reputed to be
one of the best. It was suppressed in 1539.</p>

<p>That there was laxity in the government of
some of the convents which resulted in idleness and
waste of money is evident. The Bishop of Lincoln,
Longland, sent very peremptory orders to the
Superior of the nuns of Cottam or Cottram, in
Lincolnshire, respecting her duties:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Ouer this I charge you lady prioresse undre the said
payne that ye yereby make your accompte openly and
truely in your chaptour house afore the mooste part, and
the senours of your susters that they may knowe frome
yere to yere the state of said house, and that ye streight
upon sight hereof dymynishe the nombre of your seruants
as well men as women, whiche excessyve nombre that ye
kepe of them bothe is oon of the grette causes of your
miserable povertye.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This was in the second quarter of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
As places of education the convents exercised
the most important influence on the outside world.
Even in the ninth century children were sent to
England from the continent to be educated in the
schools established by Theodorus and Hadrian.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
This is the more remarkable, as in the seventh
century there were so few convents in England
that many of the nobility sent their daughters to be
educated in France. The religious house of Brie,
of which mention has already been made, as having
a Saxon abbess, received the daughter of Earconberth,
King of Kent, during the rule of the Abbess
Fara in 640. Eight hundred years later Sir
Thomas Boleyn sent his ill-fated daughter Anne,
during her sojourn in France, to a convent at Brie
to complete her education. It seems probable that
it was the same religious house.</p>

<p>In the seventh and eighth centuries, the nuns
were as much occupied with literary studies as the
monks, reading theology and even classics, copying
manuscripts, which they adorned with wonderful
embellishments. They were able to correspond in
Latin; some were acquainted with Greek, and they
appear to have been very assiduous in the pursuit
of such literature as was available.</p>

<p>The Abbess Eadburga and her pupil Leobgitha<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
were both correspondents of the famous Archbishop
Boniface, who lived in the eighth century. On one
occasion Leobgitha sends Boniface some Latin
hexameters of her own composition. In her letter
she <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“These underwritten verses I have endeavoured to
compose according to the rules derived from the poets,
not in a spirit of presumption, but with the desire of
exciting the powers of my slender talents, and in the hope
of thine assistance therein. This art I have learnt from
Eadburga, who is ever occupied in studying the divine
law.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The lines run <span class="locked">thus&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Another nun, St. Erkenwald, had as a teacher
<span class="locked">Hildelitha&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“a woman as well excellentlie learned in the liberall
sciences as verie expert in skill of religious discipline
and life.”</p></blockquote>

<p>For many centuries, indeed as long as the conventual
system lasted, the only schools for girls
were the convent schools, where, says Robert Aske,
“the daughters of gentlemen were brought up with
virtue.” From the educational point of view, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
suppression of the convents was decidedly a
blunder; and they were not merely schools for
book-learning. Among other things were taught
the treatment of various disorders, the compounding
of simples, the binding up of wounds. The custom
of bleeding people for every form of illness, and to
ward off possible sickness, created the necessity for
some kind of bandage ready prepared to apply to
the place where the incision was made. It was
common to make these bandages of silk, and offer
them as presents.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>The pupils were also taught what might be
called fancy cookery, such as the making of sweetmeats.
Writing, drawing, needlework of all kinds,
and music, both vocal and instrumental, entered
into the curriculum.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the convents the female portion of the population
found their only teachers, the rich as well as the poor, and
the destruction of the religious houses by Henry was the
absolute extinction of any systematic education for women
during a long period. Thus at Winchester Convent, the
list of the ladies being educated within the walls at the
time of the suppression shows that these Benedictine
nuns were training the children of the first families in the
country. Carrow, in Norfolk, for centuries gave instruction
to the daughters of the neighbouring gentry, and as
early as <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1273 a papal prohibition was obtained from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Pope Gregory X., restraining the nobility from crowding
this monastery with more sisters than its income would
support.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of Mynchin Buckland we <span class="locked">read&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It was, doubtless, also a noted seminary for the
daughters of the great neighbouring families. The Berkeleys,
Erleghs, Montacutes, Wrothams, Bouchers, and
others, were ever at home at Buckland, and learned from
the good sisters all the mental accomplishments which
they in after-life possessed. Reading, writing, some knowledge
of arithmetic, the art of embroidery, music, and
French, ‘after the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,’ were the
recognized course of study, while the preparation of perfumes,
balsams, simples, and confectionery was among the
more ordinary departments of the education afforded.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When the suppression took place, the laity, who
enjoyed great benefits from the presence of the
religious houses, made ineffectual protests against
their dissolution. The famous convent of Godstow,
in Oxfordshire, was particularly regretted, as it was
<span class="locked">one&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“where there was great strictness of life, and to which
were most of the young gentlewomen of the county sent
to be bred, so that the gentry of the county desired the
king would spare the house.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The abbess herself wrote a long letter to Thomas
Cromwell, complaining of the treatment to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
she was subjected. Some portions of it may be
read with <span class="locked">interest:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Pleaseth hit your Honour with my moste humble

<p>When the conventual system came to an end,
the relation of women to the Church was materially
changed. They were no longer the Church’s
administrators and her authorized servants. And
while they could not, as before, dispense its alms
and hospitality, or impart the knowledge they had
acquired in the cloister, they themselves were deprived
of its protecting care. At the time of the
dissolution of the monasteries the “religious”
women did not exceed 1560,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> but to a large
number of others the cloister was a temporary
retreat, a possible home, a refuge in time of distress.
The effect upon women of the sweeping
away of monastic institutions may be considered
from various points of view&mdash;from the educational,
social, as well as the religious side. It may be
regarded as the work of a reformer or of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
destroyer. Mr. Lecky describes it as “far from
a benefit to women or the world.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> But that it
greatly affected the position of women there can
be no question. It loosened, although it did not
sever, the close tie which had bound women to the
spiritual authority as to a foster-mother. The
Anglican Church stood in a different relation,
socially speaking, to the people. It was a less
personal relation. And the Protestant clergy did
not make use of women in any special way as the
instruments of the Church. As will be seen later
on, the tendency during the first two centuries of
the religious revolution, as it may be termed, was
to ignore women as workers. The Roman Church,
while it plainly proclaimed women to be inferior
morally, and by inference intellectually, to men,
availed itself to the full of their capacities. Until
modern times, the Protestant Church went on its
way regardless of the fact that a great unused
power was lying close at hand. It was in movements
outside the Church that the religious emotion
in women first found vent in the Protestant era.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CHURCH AS A SOCIAL FACTOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Influence of the Church on women in social life&mdash;The twofold conception
of womanhood&mdash;Canon and Civil Law&mdash;Effect of ecclesiastical
celibacy.</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">It</span> has come to be regarded almost as truism that
women are more religious than men, that they are,
by nature, more devout, more susceptible to spiritual
influences. If Matthew Arnold’s definition of religion
as “morality touched by emotion” be accepted,
it is easy to point to the larger development
of the emotional nature in women as a cause for
their greater leaning towards religion. But for the
present purpose it is only necessary to deal with
the manifestations of this impulse; the causes
belong to the domain of psychology.</p>

<p>Before considering women’s part in the religious
life of the country, it has to be remembered that
their part in social life has been largely determined
by the Church. For centuries the Church was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
practically, the only civilizing influence, the only
restraint upon passion and lawlessness, the only
protection of the weak against the strong. It was
the Church that taught respect for womanhood,
that raised the wife from a state of subjection
amounting to slavery to a position of dignity in the
household. It was in the Church that women
sought safety, shelter, protection, livelihood, occupation,
when the home was gone, when kindred
failed, when life and honour were at stake. The
supremacy which the Church exercised over the
laity in general was emphasized in the case of
women, more prone to render unquestioning obedience
to constituted authority.</p>

<p>From the beginning the Church was quick to
recognize the value of women’s adherence, and the
importance of the services which they could render.
By raising women, the Church created a power for
its own uses. And women were as quick to
respond. They gave themselves freely. Whatever
the Church has done for women has been repaid
by them tenfold. Their labour, their property, their
lives were placed at the disposal of the Church.
They gave something more&mdash;their freedom of
thought, their independence of action. Their minds,
as well as their consciences, were in the keeping of
the priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
The Church, while with one hand it raised
woman from the abasement into which she had
been cast by Paganism, lowered her with the other.
When it taught men to pay respect to their wives,
when it interfered with the tyranny which placed
women in complete subjection to their male relatives,
it was that women might come directly under
the priestly power. The Church had no intention
of setting women free to act independently. It was
only a change of masters. This was seen especially
about the fourth century, when the clergy had
begun to degenerate from their former simplicity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Then the men, exiling the women by degrees, took the
sole government of the church into their own hands, and
assembling together, made what canons they pleased for
their own secular advantage. Then were some published
against the ordination of priestesses, deaconesses, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The same thing is observable in the next
century.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Women in most places were denied all ecclesiastical
offices, and commanded to be silent in the churches, and so
it continued for several centuries even till the ancient faith
began to bud forth again (after that great night of apostacy)
among the Waldenses, who justified women’s preaching.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Church was careful to impress women with
a sense of their inferiority. It has even been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
denied that Christianity&mdash;or rather its exponents&mdash;did
anything to elevate women to a higher social
status.</p>

<blockquote>

<p xml:lang="de" lang="de">“Das Christenthum brachte der Frau keine Erlösung aus
ihrer Erniedrigung. Im Gegentheil! War sie in der heidnischen
Welt nur die Sklavin, die Waare, das Hausthier
gewesen, so wurde sie jetzt noch ausserdem zum ‘Gefäss
der Hölle’ erklärt.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This remark is borne out by Tertullian’s <span class="locked">apostrophe&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Woman! thou oughtest always to walk in mourning
and rags, thine eyes filled with tears of repentance, to make
men forget that thou hast been the destruction of the race.
Woman, thou art the gate of hell.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A curious contradiction appears in theological
teaching. It is difficult to reconcile the conception
of womanhood which found its expression in
Mariolatry with that which was given voice to by
the Fathers, which proclaimed woman unfit to
receive the Eucharist in her naked hands, which
forbade her to approach the altar,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> which taught
that she was a temptation in man’s way to try him,
which regarded the married state as a condition of
sin, and even among the laity exalted virginity and
celibacy as a species of sainthood. In a treatise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
on chastity attributed to Sixtus III., married people
are said to risk, though not entirely to forfeit,
eternal happiness. St. Martin of Tours considered
marriage pardonable, but virginity glorious. St.
Jerome spoke of marriage as at best a vice: “All
that we can do is to excuse and purify it.” Tertullian
was much stronger: “Celibacy,” he wrote,
“must be chosen, though the human race perish in
consequence.”</p>

<p>The higher conception of womanhood was an
ideal only, a theme for poets, a dream of saints;
the lower conception was the guide for common
life, the basis of everyday teaching. It was this
lower conception which, in different ways, determined
women’s position in society. Gradually the
precepts of the canon law found their way into
common law, and the subordination enforced upon
women in matters spiritual was extended to matters
temporal. The supremacy which canon law obtained
is easily accounted for when we compare
the disciplined character of all ecclesiastical as
compared with lay government, the training of the
priest with that of the noble, the ignorance pervading
all classes, and the rude character of the
legislation administered in feudal society.</p>

<p>The Roman conquest brought the legislative
code of the empire into Britain, but with the advent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
of Christianity Roman law was gradually coloured
by ecclesiastical law, and assumed a different complexion.
Some writers go so far as to say that
Roman law was entirely superseded. Through the
law the Church kept an invisible hold upon the
people, and compelled subjugation to its decrees.
The Church, however, did not need shelter or excuse
for any of its acts. It was powerful enough to
command obedience to whatever it chose to decree.
There was no influence greater, no authority more
dreaded. Its rival, education, was but a puny
stripling, without armour or weapons.</p>

<p>In the tenth century we find a repetition of the
ecclesiastical law excluding women from certain
parts of the church. There is a Saxon constitution
which <span class="locked">runs&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“We charge that at the time when the priest sings mass
no woman be nigh the altar, but that they stand in their
own place, and that the mass priest there receive of them
what they are willing to offer.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Women were not suffered to penetrate within
the altar precincts in the sixteenth century. It is
related that Sir Thomas More’s wife did not sit
with her husband in the chancel, but in some other
part of the church, in what are described as the
common parish seats.</p>

<p>The entrance of women within the Church of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Durham was limited to a certain point in the nave
marked by a blue cross on the marble pavement, in
accordance with the rule of St. Cuthbert. One
day in the year 1333, Queen Philippa, wife of
Edward III., paid a visit to Durham Cathedral,
supped with the king in the Prior’s chamber, and
retired to rest in the apartment arranged for her
husband in the priory. The monks were scandalized,
and sought an interview with the king, who
bade the queen rise, which she did immediately,
and, clad only in her night array, went over from
the priory buildings to the castle for the night,
beseeching St. Cuthbert’s pardon for having polluted
sacred ground with her presence.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical law affected women very disastrously
by the enforcement of priestly celibacy.
Although against the rules of the Church, marriage
was common among the clergy in pre-Norman
times, especially in the north of England. Substantial
reasons existed against allowing priests to
marry. There were complaints that the married
clergy took the Church property to provide marriage
portions for their sons and daughters and legacies
for their wives, and were generally in the habit of
applying ecclesiastical funds to their private uses.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is all the worse when they have it all, for they do not
dispose of it as they ought, but decorate their wives with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
what they should the altars, and turn everything to their
own worldly pomp.... Let those who before this had
the evil custom of decorating their women as they should
the altars refrain from this evil custom, and decorate their
churches as they best can; then would they command for
themselves both divine counsel and worldly worship. A
priest’s wife is nothing but a snare of the devil, and he
who is ensnared thereby on to his end will be seized fast
by the devil.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the tenth century, priests were found deserting
their wives for other women. No doubt
scandals of this kind, and other grave abuses, induced
the Winchester Council in 1076 to make a declaration
against the marriage of priests. All future
marriages were forbidden, but parish priests who
were already married were allowed to keep their
wives. In the next century severe measures were
taken. A Council was convened at London in 1102,
when it was decreed that no married priest could
celebrate. The controversy on clerical celibacy
went on by fits and starts, until the Lateran
Council in 1215 definitely pronounced against
marriage. Meanwhile the clergy had followed their
own instincts, and evaded the ordinances against
marriage by taking concubines, like Bishop Nigel
of Ely, in the twelfth century. That prelate’s
partner was the valiant Maud of Ramsbury, who
bravely defended the castle of Devizes against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
King Stephen, and only capitulated when the
enemy, having stolen her son, threatened to hang
him before her eyes.</p>

<p>The document entitled, “Instructions for Parish
Priests,” composed not later than the middle of the
fifteenth century, shows that it was quite common
for priests to be married, though the practice was
reprobated, and “chastity,” meaning abstinence
from wedlock, was enjoined. But those who were
too weak to live honestly and uprightly as celibates
are told to take a wife. Dr. Jessop states that by
the eleventh century country parsons had almost
ceased to be married men, though Benedicts were
found among them here and there as late as the
thirteenth century, when a veto was put upon
priests’ marriages.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> The decrees of provincial
councils prove the existence of priestly concubinage
down to the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The worst effects of the celibate system were
seen in the sixteenth century. Debauchery was
spread throughout the country. As many as one
hundred thousand women were ruined by the
priests, for whom houses of ill fame were kept.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
From Carnarvonshire came complaints of the well-to-do
laity, that their wives and daughters were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
safe from outrage by the priests. Out of their own
mouths the clergy are condemned. In 1536 the
secular clergy in the diocese of Bangor wrote to
Cromwell, that if their women were taken away
they would be homeless outcasts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We ourselves shall be driven to seek our living at all
houses and taverns, for mansions upon the benefices and
vicarages we have none. And as for gentlemen and substantial
honest men, for fear of inconvenience, and knowing
our frailty and accustomed liberty, they will in no wise
board us in their houses.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In this year the Lower House of Convocation
presented a memorial inveighing against priestly
marriages. But in the reign of Edward VI., what
might be called a Permissive Bill was passed for
the sufficient reason that “great filthiness of living
had followed on the laws that compelled chastity
and prohibited marriage.” Under Queen Mary
celibacy was again enforced, married priests were
ejected from their livings, and even those who
renounced their wives were not always secure of
their places. Elizabeth had a great aversion to
married priests, and openly expressed her contempt
for their wives, whom she could not bring herself
to receive at Court. But though she demurred
a good deal to giving a formal assent to ecclesiastical
marriages, the Act of Edward VI. was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
eventually reinforced, a reaction having set in with
the rise of the Protestant party. The Act was
hedged round with various restrictions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“No manner of priest or deacon shall hereafter take to
his wife any manner of woman without the advice and
allowance first had upon good examination by the bishop
of the same diocese and two justices of the peace of the
same shire dwelling next to the place where the same
woman hath made her most abode before her marriage;
not without the good-will of the parents of the said woman,
if she have any living, or two of the next of her kinsfolks,
or for lack of the knowledge of such, of her master or
mistress where she serveth.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The advantages and disadvantages of celibacy,
and the manner of life proper for the married and
the unmarried priest, are set forth by George
Herbert in his dissertation on the “Country
Parson.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The country parson, considering that virginity is a
higher state than matrimony, and that the ministry requires
the best and highest things, is rather unmarried than
married. But yet, as the temper of his body may be, or
as the temper of his parish may be, where he may have
occasion to converse with women, and that among suspicious
men, and other like circumstances considered, he is
rather married than unmarried.... If he be unmarried,
he hath not a woman in his house, but finds opportunities
of having his meat dressed and other services done by
men-servants at home, and his linen washed abroad. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
he be unmarried and sojourn, he never talks with any
women alone, but in the audience of others; and that
seldom, and then also in a serious manner, never jestingly
or sportfully....</p>

<p>“If he be married, the choice of his wife was made
rather by his ear than by his eye; his judgment, not his
affection, found out a fit wife for him....</p>

<p>“As he is just in all things, so is he to his wife also....
Therefore he gives her respect both afore her servants and
others, and half at least of the government of the house,
reserving so much of the affairs as serve for a diversion
for him; yet never giving over the reins, but that he sometimes
looks how things go.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The ideal wife is thus described:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Instead of the qualities of the world, he requires only
three of her. First, training up of her children and maids
in the fear of God; with prayers and catechising and all
religious duties. Secondly, a curing and healing of all
wounds and sores with her own hands; which skill either
she brought with her, or he takes care she shall learn it of
some religious neighbour. Thirdly, a providing for her
family in some such sort, as that neither they want a competent
sustentation, nor her husband be brought into debt.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In modern times a section of the clergy in the
English Church have shown a disposition to revert
to the practice of earlier ages, and follow a celibate
life. It is part of the ascetic movement which
some years ago was rather a marked feature in the
Church. But even among those Anglicans who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
recoil from the term “Protestant,” and endeavour to
preserve as much as possible of the forms of Church
government which prevailed in pre-Reformation
times, there are few comparatively who adopt this
species of monasticism.</p>

<p>No doubt marriage has greatly helped to break
down the authority of the priest. A man with a
wife and family living the domestic life of an ordinary
citizen is brought at once to the level of
common humanity, priest though he be. He loses
that glamour which attached to him when he was
cut off from his fellows and set apart on another
plane by virtue of his office. Women, more than
men, have been in all ages prone to superstitious
reverence for ecclesiastical authority. They are still
apt to look to the clergyman to guide them in the
daily affairs of secular life, not because they consider
him better qualified intellectually than other
men, but because they have a lurking remnant of
belief in priestly infallibility. There are many who
make the clergyman a referee on all subjects, of whatever
nature, and look upon him as the proper head
of every movement, educational, philanthropic, or
otherwise, irrespective of his qualifications for such
a position. The deference paid to clerical opinion
and the leaning on clerical authority are survivals
of old habits of thought, weakened in the process<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
of transmission, but having a strong principle of
vitality.</p>

<p>The counterbalancing force to the influence of
the Church on women is to be found not merely in
its acknowledged rivals, intellectual development
and the progress of secular knowledge, but in the
motive-power of the religious sentiment. It has
been justly observed <span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“the clergy of all ages, in concentrating the strength of
woman on her religious nature, have summoned up a
power that they could not control. When they had once
lost the confidence of those ruled by this mighty religious
sentiment, it was turned against them. In the Greek and
Roman worship women were the most faithful to the
altars of the gods; yet when Christianity arose, the foremost
martyrs were women. In the Middle Ages women
were the best Catholics, but they were afterwards the best
Huguenots. It was a woman, not a man, that threw the
stool at the offending minister’s head in a Scotch kirk; it
was a woman who made the best Quaker martyr on
Boston common. And from vixennish Jenny Geddes to
high-minded Mary Dyer, the whole range of womanly
temperament responds as well to the appeal of religious
freedom as of religious slavery.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A French writer in the middle of the present
century, describing England during the Ages of
Faith, with its surname of the “Isle of Saints,” as
“un spectacle digne des anges,” laments its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
coldness and lack of virtue under Protestantism.
In what he styles this materialistic <span class="locked">age&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“la femme est loin, bien loin d’être ce qu’elle fut
pour l’opinion publique aux époques de foi vive et
ardente.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The expression of the religious sentiment has
taken a different form. It may be less obvious and
definite, but in the opinion of one of our modern
thinkers it is the mainspring of all <span class="locked">progress&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Nothing can be more obvious,” writes Mr. Kidd,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> “as
soon as we begin to understand the nature of the process
of evolution in progress around us, than that the moving
force behind it is not the intellect, and that the development
as a whole is not in any true sense an intellectual
development.</p></blockquote>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<blockquote>

<p>“The intellect is employed in developing ground which
has been won for it by other forces. But it would appear
that it has by itself no power to occupy this ground; it
has not even any power to continue to hold it after it has
been won, when these forces have spent and exhausted
themselves. The evolution which is slowly proceeding in
human society is not primarily intellectual, but religious in
character.”</p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">ALMSGIVING IN OLDEN TIMES.</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Almsgiving at the monasteries&mdash;Charity dispensed by private families&mdash;Bequests
of ladies for the relief of the poor&mdash;Action of the
Church&mdash;Change in the conception of the duty of almsgiving&mdash;Needlework
for the poor&mdash;Modern gilds&mdash;Charity at the present
day.</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">In</span> the days preceding the poor law&mdash;that is, before
the dissolution of the monasteries&mdash;charity to the
poor was regarded in much the same light as
hospitality among equals. Just as it was an unwritten
law that strangers on all occasions must be
entertained, so it was an accepted rule of life for
the wealthy to support their poor neighbours with
doles in money and in kind. The monasteries
were the great dispensers of alms; but every
nobleman’s or gentleman’s house had also a number
of poor who looked to it for support. The feudal
system was in a great measure responsible for this
feeling of dependence. Nobody under that system
stood alone. The poor were bound to the soil, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
their lives were inextricably woven&mdash;not always for
their good&mdash;into the lives of those above them.
With the dispensation of doles and the care of the
poor the ladies in the households of the nobility
were much concerned. It was the business of the
mistress to see that the sick were cared for, the
needy visited, and that the aged had their wants
supplied. Charity was less far-reaching, and had no
pretence at organization; it was a part of domestic
life, not an outside business to be taken up and
laid down at will. What is now done by means of
paid officials was then all accomplished by the
donors themselves. The charity which now passes
through numerous channels before it reaches the
recipient went then by a comparatively direct route.</p>

<p>Great families sometimes marked the Church
festivals by special almsgiving, and would celebrate
marriage anniversaries in the same way. This was
the custom in the family of Lord William Howard
at Naworth Castle. The giving away of money at
other times seems to have been rather spasmodic.
The steward of the Howard family frequently
records: “To my Lady to give away 20/-.” Besides
what was dispensed in that way, there were lists of
doles to the poor, such as sixpence to a poor
woman; sixpence to a poor leper boy; “To the
poor at Armathwate 6<i>d.</i>” (which shows how much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
more sixpence was worth then); “To the pore at
Carlyle 1/6.” There was giving at funerals too;
the steward records, “Bestowed in bread and beer
at the buriall of the plumber 5/-,” among the extraordinary
payments; where we also find items for
shoemending recorded, such as, “Mending a pair of
shoes 4<i>d.</i>” It was customary for a person who
had any property at all to leave a sum of money to
be given to the poor on the day of his or her
burial. Thus Mrs. Susannah Eyre, a widow of
substantial means who lived in the seventeenth
century, left twopence a piece for the poor who
should attend her funeral, besides a bequest of
goods and chattels to be distributed among the
poor of specified districts.</p>

<p>Great ladies usually recognized their duties
among the poor, not only by giving doles, but by
founding almshouses. There were, probably, not
many who actually maintained a number of poor
within their own walls like Margaret Beaufort,
Countess of Richmond. This celebrated lady used
to maintain twelve poor people under her roof when
she retired to her manor of Woking, where Dr.
John Fisher acted as her confessor and almoner.</p>

<p>Nearly every lady of distinction did something
of a permanent nature for the relief of the poor.
The famous Bess of Hardwick, in the midst of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
building of palaces, did not forget to erect and
liberally endow an almshouse for the poor at Derby.
The Countess of Pembroke not only built an
almshouse, but procured a patent by which it was
turned into a corporation. Various are the charities
bequeathed by noble ladies in the sixteenth, seventeenth,
and eighteenth centuries for the relief of the
poor. Lady Gresham in 1560 left tenements in
the city, the rents of which were to be used for the
poor, partly in money and partly in coals. Mrs.
Frances Clark left £200 to the Skinners’ Company
to pay £10 a year for the poor of St. Thomas’s,
Southwark. Dame Isabell Gray, of Ogle Castle,
Northumberland, left a sum of money for the poor,
to be given at the day of her burial. Instances
might be multiplied, such as the bequest of Lady
Middleton in 1645, of Viscountess Conway in 1637,
of Lady Mico in 1670, of Mrs. Ridley in 1716.
Money that is now given to societies was then left
to individuals.</p>

<p>The care of the poor from the days of Dorcas
downwards has always been deemed women’s
special work, but it has been largely controlled by
the church. In olden times a great lady would
choose for her almoner a monk, or at least a
priest. The Church has endeavoured to maintain
its authority in this respect down to the present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
day. A large portion of the ancient endowments
and funds for the relief of the poor is in its hands.
Great ladies and women in all ranks still frequently
allow their charities to be filtered through the
medium of the Church. The visiting of the poor
is carried on under ecclesiastical guidance. The
Church in modern times has striven to become the
fountain and head of all benevolence, and, as a great
organized institution, discourages outside efforts.
Women in country districts dispense most of their
charity under the direction of the priest, except
where there happens to be a great lady who
chooses to assert her independence, and is powerful
enough to act alone.</p>

<p>In large towns, the whole social life being so
complex, there is more scope for individuality in
work. The Church is less dominant, being brought
into rivalry with lay organizations. But in secular
work there is a tendency for women to run in a
groove. The immense gain that accrues from
combination in work, the pernicious effects of indiscriminate
charity, and the impossibility of dealing
with a huge floating population of indigent persons
except by well-organized methods, have a tendency
to convert hundreds of women workers into mere
automata, obeying the behests of some central
authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
The whole conception of almsgiving has changed.
In the Middle Ages, and for a considerable period
after, it was regarded as a soul-saving process, of
much the same value as saying masses or practising
mortifications. Sovereigns were frequently expected
to honour the festivals of the saints by
entertaining immense numbers of indigent persons,
and the royal munificence was often severely taxed.
That a woman should be bountiful to the poor,
according to her means, was a cardinal virtue which
ranked with truth and chastity.</p>

<p>The support of the poor has now become a
social rather than a personal obligation. It has
been converted from a pious duty into a State
practice. The religious element, in spite of the
influence of the Church, has much diminished.
Charity still covers some of our sins, but not the
multitude it was wont to envelop. Souls are no
longer saved by a distribution of loaves and
blankets, or weekly doles to the poor. The element
of personal service, which was once thought
essential, has also faded into comparative insignificance.
Charity may be done by deputy, by
a stroke of the pen. It cannot, of course, be
supposed that great ladies in former times did not
exercise a good deal of benevolence by indirect
means; but it may be affirmed that a mediæval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
gentlewoman who did not perform some personal
office for the relief of the poor, would have been
severely censured for her neglect and impiety
unless she silenced the priests by exceptionally
large gifts. Now a lady may walk through life
unrebuked, though she has never with her own
hands performed a single act of charity.</p>

<p>In former days noble ladies&mdash;that is, those of a
pious disposition&mdash;occupied themselves largely in
making garments for the poor. Queens, princesses,
and ladies of rank would toil for hours at a time,
and give up a portion of each day, to the conversion
of coarse cloth into suitable apparel for
their humble neighbours, who counted upon this
charity. Each lady, assisted possibly by her
maids, provided for the wants of those who were
nearest at hand. Needlework, which since the
introduction of machinery has fallen to a lower
level of repute, was formerly the occupation most
highly esteemed among women. It was not only
a duty, but a pious exercise. While some salved
their consciences with elaborate embroidery for
church purposes, others were contented to plod
along the homely seam, to fashion smocks and
cloaks for the toilers, and bed-linen and blankets
for the sick.</p>

<p>In the present century needlework has received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
an impetus from the formation of gilds and
societies. Nearly all the work for the poor is done
in this associated manner. The workers, instead
of distributing their productions personally, send
them more often to some centre to be dispensed in
an organized fashion. It is curious to note how,
in spite of the invention of the sewing-machine, the
women of the middle classes cling to the old
methods. A dozen to twenty ladies will meet
together at regular intervals for four or five hours
to accomplish what a quarter of their number
could do with machines in a tithe of the time.
If working parties had no other object than the
ostensible one of providing raiment for the poor,
or clothing savages, they would not continue to
flourish.</p>

<p>In olden times great ladies sat in their tapestried
chambers, toiling painfully to convert the coarse
cloth spun in their own households into smocks and
gowns for dwellers in the windowless, smoke-begrimed
hovels of the neighbouring hamlets.
The great ladies of the present day, from their
cosy boudoirs, issue schemes for the enrolment of
women all over the country into gilds and societies
for providing clothing for the poor. Instead of
working singly, they co-operate. The names of
H.R.H. Princess Henry of Battenberg, H.R.H.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
the Duchess of Teck, and Lady Wolverton will
occur readily as leaders of needlework gilds.</p>

<p>The articles made by these gilds are sent to
the clergy for distribution among their poor
parishioners, to homes and hospitals, even to
prisons. There are many schools for girls of the
educated classes where a portion of time is set
apart for needlework for the poor, the aim being
twofold: to teach the girls how to work, and to
cultivate the spirit of service. The old customs
are being revived in a different dress. People who
are afraid that the ways of our ancestors are quite
forgotten and despised in the whirl of new notions,
may take comfort from the thought of how much
attention is given to the serious study of homely
duties. Science has been introduced into the
domestic arts. The same things are being done,
but in better ways. This is specially true with
regard to philanthropy. Almsgiving, which was
once regarded as a religious duty, has now become
a positive evil. Society as now constituted, far
from benefiting, suffers much from any attempt to
return to the old forms of benevolence. Weekly
doles of bread, and the flinging of coppers to beggars
in the street, help to dislocate the social machinery.
In the innumerable channels which modern charity
has found for itself, the aim is to secure the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
independence of the recipients. Formerly, almsgiving
had a double object&mdash;to benefit the soul of
the donor as well as contribute to the welfare of
the poor. At the present day, almsgiving, or the
more cautious benevolence which has taken its
place, is single in purpose, and has for its sole end
the well-being of the beneficiary.</p>

<p class="hang">Effect on Women of the fall of Feudalism&mdash;Characteristics of Tudor
England&mdash;Observations of foreigners on Englishwomen&mdash;Greater
liberty allowed to women in England than on the Continent&mdash;Social
habits and amusements&mdash;Women’s education&mdash;English

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">The</span> fall of feudalism, which meant the break-up of
the power of the nobles, had as great an influence
on the position of women in England as the overthrow
of the supremacy of the Roman Church.
Women in everyday life are more affected by a
social than a religious change. The king might
refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Pope,
monasteries might be stripped of their wealth and
the Church of its endowments, but women who
were not nuns, or destined for a religious life, did
not feel the upheaval which was undermining the
power of the priest as they felt the storm which
shattered the power of the noble. Whatever the
form of Church government might be, women did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
not cease to recognize the duty of obedience to
spiritual directors. But when the family no longer
owed obedience to a feudal lord, when personal
service was at an end, when the labourer was free
to work for his own profit, the change that was
passing over social life was very distinctly felt by
families in the humbler ranks. Of the third great
force, the mental freedom given by the Renaissance,
there are naturally fewer signs, for its influence was
confined chiefly to the upper classes.</p>

<p>The dawn of the sixteenth century was the
dawn of a new era, social, religious, and commercial.
It was the beginning of a gradual transformation
which with every century, with every generation,
takes some new form, and is sometimes called
progress, sometimes revolution, but which moves on
with the same relentless persistence as the laws
that govern the earth.</p>

<p>It was a rough world in which women found
themselves at liberty to come and go, to taste new
pleasures, enjoy fresh luxuries, hear new opinions,
and think new thoughts. But, at least, it was a
world of action, of striving, of pushing forward.
Despotic as was the throne, oppressive as were the
new landowning class, a freer spirit prevailed.
Social changes work gradually, and their influence
is not at once perceived; but the germ of modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
England was working in those days of religious
stress, intellectual activity, and commercial enterprise.</p>

<p>The visits of foreigners to England in the sixteenth
century enable us to see ourselves as others
saw us. The position of women and the relations
of the sexes always excited comment from
strangers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Wives,” writes a Dutchman, “are not kept so strictly
as they are in Spain or elsewhere. Nor are they shut up,
but they have the free management of the house or
housekeeping, after the fashion of those of the Netherlands
and others their neighbours. They go to market to buy
what they like best to eat. They are well dressed, fond
of taking it easy, and commonly leave the care of household
matters and drudgery to their servants. They sit
before their doors, decked out in fine clothes, in order to
see and be seen by the passers-by. In all banquets and
feasts they are shown the greatest honour. They are
placed at the upper end of the table, where they are first
served; at the lower end they help the men. All the rest
of their time they employ in walking and riding, in playing
at cards or otherwise, in visiting their friends and
keeping company, conversing with their equals (whom
they term gossips) and their neighbours, and making
merry with them at child-births, christenings, churchings,
and funerals; and all this with the permission and knowledge
of their husbands, as such is the custom. Although
the husbands often recommend to them the pains, industry,
and care of the German or Dutch women, who do what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the men ought to do both in the house and the shops,
for which services in England men are employed, nevertheless
the women usually persist in retaining their
customs. This is why England is called the paradise of
married women. The girls who are not yet married are
kept much more rigorously and strictly than in the Low
Countries.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Another observer <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The women have much more liberty than perhaps
in any other place.... The females have great liberty,
and are almost like masters.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Manners were very free, nowhere more so than
among persons of quality, and language was very
coarse to modern ears. But if women did not
hesitate to use an oath, if their behaviour to men
seems bold and their coquetry of a type too pronounced,
it must be remembered that they only
adopted the tone of the society in which they lived.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In all the world,” says a sixteenth-century writer,
“there is no regyon nor countrie that doth use more
swearynge than is used in Englande, for a chylde that
scarse can speake, a boy, a gyrle, a wenche, now-a-dayes
wyl swere as great othes as an old knave and an olde
drabbe.... As for swearers a man nede not to seke for
theym, for in the Kynges courte and lordes courtes in
cities, borowes and in townes, and in every house, in maner
there is abbominable swerynge, and no man dothe go about
to redresse it, but doth take swearyng as for no synne,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
whiche is a damnable synne; and they the which doth use
it, be possessed of the Devill, and no man can helpe them
but God and the kyng.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The attitude of men towards women had
undoubtedly changed. The old chivalric notions
had died away, and with them a good deal of false
sentiment. Tudor England did not set woman up
on a pinnacle as a being endowed with supernatural
virtues and charms. It did not make quests on
her behalf, or court danger for the sake of a smile.
Tudor England had something else to think about.
It was busy with foreign enterprises, discovering
new lands; with commerce and trade, building up
a solid foundation of wealth; with new branches
of knowledge, with fresh studies of old things, with
reconstituting its religious beliefs, and with keeping
up its head among the nations. Poets in the
Middle Ages had sung of woman as an angel,
ecclesiastical asceticism had treated her as little
better than a demon, but the men of the sixteenth
century were of a different mould. They had
something of the modern spirit, and looked upon
woman as a being to share in the common burdens
and pleasures of life, not to be worshipped or
shunned.</p>

<p>It is clear that in England women had attained
to a greater degree of freedom in daily life than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
on the Continent. Frederick Duke of Wirtemberg,
who was in England about the year 1592, <span class="locked">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The women have much more liberty than perhaps
in any other place; they also know well how to make
use of it; for they go dressed out in exceedingly fine
clothes, and give all their attention to their ruffs and
stuffs by such a degree indeed that, as I am informed,
many a one does not hesitate to wear velvet in the streets,
which is common with them, whilst at home perhaps they
have not a piece of dry bread.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Increase of luxury had an injurious effect on
certain industries. People were no longer satisfied
with home-made products, but coveted the resources
of the capital. Laments are uttered that the trade
in certain towns is <span class="locked">decaying&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“While men weare contented with suche thinges as
weare made within the market townes next unto theim,
then weare they of oure townes and cities well set aworke,
as I knewe the time when men weare contented with
cappes, hattes, girdelles and poyntes and all maner of
(garmentes) made in the townes next adjoyninge; whereby
the townes then weare well occupied and set aworke and
yet the money paid for the same stuffe remayned in the
countrie. Nowe the porest yonge man in a country can
not be contented either with a lether girdle, or lether
pointes, gloves, kynues or daggers made nighe home.
And specially no gentleman can be content to have
eyther cappe, coate, dublet, hose or shirt made in his
countrey, but they must haue theire geare from London;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
and yet manye thinges thearof are not theare made, but
beyonde the sea; whereby the artificers of oure townes
are idle.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Queen Elizabeth made ineffectual attempts to
circumscribe London, whose boundaries were rapidly
enlarging under the pressure of the growing population
and the constant influx of provincials and
foreigners. About this time stone building began
to be common, the old timber houses being replaced
by more solid if less picturesque edifices.</p>

<p>Complaints were made of people flocking to
London from the country, and wasting their substance
in <span class="locked">revels&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“When husband hath at play set up his rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then wife and babes at home a hungry goeth.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“The maister may keepe revell all the yeere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave the wife at home like silly foule.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Country dames did not often share in the jaunts
to the capital made by their husbands. Until the
seventeenth century it did not become customary
for families to go to London for annual visits. Bad
roads and the lack of public conveyances kept town
and country apart. The squire’s lady knew nothing
of the bustling life led in the sombre, substantial
houses of the London burgesses, for whose wives
there was plenty of occupation in looking after the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
servants and the apprentices who formed part of
the household, in superintending the cooking of
the bountiful meals, buying the household necessaries,
and replenishing the family wardrobe. There
were no newspapers, but there was abundance of
gossip, a much more impressive medium of communicating
news. Amusement took the form of
spectacles chiefly, and the citizens and citizenesses
flocked readily to a mask, a play, a procession, a
cock-fight, or a bear-baiting. Women were not
squeamish about unpleasant sights. They had not
learnt to feel that the brutal sports so common
then were degrading. It was hardly likely that
they should. There were too many hangings and
quarterings and burnings of human beings in
London to make people sensitive about the pain
of animals. The gallows were constantly working,
and women had to accustom themselves to many
revolting sights. Worse times were coming, but
as yet the shadow of the great civil war had not
darkened England.</p>

<p>With regard to the education of women in
every-day life, there is no evidence to show that
they shared in the higher learning cultivated so
assiduously by the daughters of the aristocracy.
What M. Paul Rousselot says in his “History of
the Education of Women in France,” applies equally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
well to England. The majority of women in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries profited little, he considers,
by the great movement known as the Renaissance.
To a large extent they were outside <span class="locked">it&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“On ne les a pas en général volontairement introduites
dans ce progrès, elles y sont entrées, un peu d’elles mêmes,
beaucoup par la force des choses.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">When we read of women discoursing in Latin,
writing in Greek, discussing philosophy and science,
we must be on our guard, says M. Rousselot, from
believing that the initiators of the modern spirit
had any idea that the moment was come to institute
for women a rational system of instruction and
education.</p>

<p>Certainly in England there were no women
of the burgess class who could discourse in Latin,
and the wives and daughters of country squires
were equally guiltless of any such accomplishments.
No systematic attempt was made to raise the
standard of women’s education in the middle ranks.
The founders of the endowed grammar schools in
the sixteenth century never thought of girls; they
only provided for boys. Queen Elizabeth, excellent
scholar as she was, and keen as was her appreciation
of learning, did nothing for the intellectual advancement
of her female subjects. The Virgin Queen
only acted like her compeers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Scarcely has there ever appeared, in any period or in
any nation, a legislator who has made it the subject of his
serious attention, and the men who are greatly interested
that women should be sensible and virtuous, seem, by
their conduct towards that sex, to have entered into a
general conspiracy to order it otherwise.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>Hitherto there had been two careers open to
women&mdash;marriage and the conventual life. With
the sweeping away of the religious houses there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
remained only the first. English family life has
been lauded as the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beau idéal</i> of domesticity, but,
as far as women were concerned, it was a very
narrow ideal. There seemed no place for the
daughters who failed to find husbands. One
wonders what became of the unmarried women.
They were probably condemned to drudge for their
relatives, like Samuel Pepys’ sister, who came into
his household as a servant.</p>

<p>There was much severity exercised towards
children among all classes. Poor Lady Jane Grey
pathetically relates how glad she was to go to her
tutor to escape the blows, pinches, and constant
reprimands which she received when in the presence
of her parents, and Lady Jane was by no means
of a refractory disposition. After this it is less
surprising to find, at an earlier period, one of the
Paston family, whose well-known letters throw so
much light on domestic life in the fifteenth century,
ill treated and beaten as if she were an unruly
slave.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“She [Elizabeth Paston, daughter of Agnes Paston]
was never in so great sorrow as she is nowadays,” wrote
one of the relatives in June, 1454; “for she may not speak
with no man, whosoever come, ne not may see nor speak
with any man, nor with servants of her mother’s, but that
she beareth on her hand otherwise than she meaneth; and
she hath since Easter the most part been beaten once in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the week or twice, and sometimes twice on a day, and her
head broken in two or three places.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Dame Paston did not approve of having
marriageable daughters about her at home. One
she had sent to a certain Cousin Calthorp, who,
when he was making changes in his household,
wished to be rid of his charge. She writes in some
perturbation to her <span class="locked">son&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“He seth she waxeth hygh, and it wer tyme to
purvey her a mariage. I marvell what causeth hym to
write so now; outher she hath displeased hym or elles he
hath takyn her with diffraught. Therfor I pray you
comune with my Cosyn Clere at London, and wete how
he is dysposyd to her ward, and send me word, for I shall
be fayn to send for her, and with me she shall but lese
her tyme, and with ought she will be better occupied she
shall often tymes meve me and put me in gret inquietenesse.
Remembr what labour I had with your suster,
therfor do your parte to help her forth, that may be your
wurchiep and myn.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Girls married very young, and the poet who
makes a daughter lament that at fifteen she had
not found a husband, was probably not exaggerating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>A Venetian noble who accompanied an ambassador
from Venice to the English court in the
sixteenth century <span class="locked">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The want of affection in the English is strongly
manifested towards their children; for after having kept
them at home till they arrive at the age of seven or nine
years at the utmost, they put them out, both males and
females, to hard service in the houses of other people,
binding them generally for another seven or nine years.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, we find children described
<span class="locked">as&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“most ongracious grafftes, ripe and redy in all lewd
libertie,” through the fault of the parents and schoolmasters,
“which do nother teach ther children good,

<p>In the following century people looked back
with regret to the time when daughters <span class="locked">were&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“obsequious and helpful to their parents,” when “there
was no supposed humiliation in offices which are now
accounted menial, but which the peer received as a matter
of course from ‘the gentlemen of his household,’ and
which were paid to the knights or gentlemen by domestics
chosen in the families of their own most respectable
tenants; whilst in the humbler ranks of middle life it was
the uniform and recognized duty of the wife to wait on
her husband, the child on his parents, the youngest of the
family on his elder brothers and sisters.”</p></blockquote>

renaissance. Fresh streams of intellectual life
were poured into the nation. There was activity
in all departments of thought. The study of
poetry, of theology, of the classics, went on apace.
The printing press was letting loose floods of knowledge.
The tide swept the women of the nobility
along in its course. They stand out prominently
among the ranks of scholars. In place of the
domestic arts, they are found immersed in classics,
divinity, and philosophy. Education was not conducted
on the easy, pleasant lines of our own day.
Knowledge was hard to obtain. It was locked up
out of reach of the indolent in languages to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
there were none of the modern keys. Literature
was the great study, and familiarity with Greek and
Latin essential. The tree of science had only just
begun to grow, and was sorely beset by the brambles
of superstition and mysticism. The arts in England
could scarcely be said to exist. Foreign painters
came from time to time, and rich noblemen went
abroad and brought back treasures from Italy.
All decorative work other than tapestries, which
were sometimes of English make, was imported.
Music, like dancing, was cultivated as a polite
accomplishment, for private uses; but there was not
the stimulus of excellent public performances by
first-rate artists.</p>

<p>History was in the form of chronicles and
romances. Stow was the great contemporary writer
engaged in recording for future generations the
events passing around him. Books in living languages
were scarce, though not so few as when
the Dowager-Duchess of Buckingham left what
was deemed a notable legacy of four volumes to
her daughter-in-law, Margaret Beaufort, Countess
of Richmond. French and Italian, especially the
latter, were studied by the nobility with continental
masters, or acquired by means of travel.
Great courtesy was shown to visitors from the
continent by the English aristocracy, who delighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
in having intercourse with men of other nationalities,
and often surrounded themselves with foreign
servants. In this way a taste was fostered for the
Spanish, French, and Italian languages. Nobles
who did not want to study themselves, liked to be
surrounded by men of learning, and willingly gave
poor authors a seat at their table. It became
customary to dedicate every new book to some rich
patron, and though it was a practice that opened
the door to abuses, it secured, on the other hand,
a subsistence to deserving authors who would otherwise
have been unable to pursue their studies.</p>

<p>Although the nobility extended their patronage
to learned men, they were not greatly given to
study themselves. In the time of Henry VIII.
there was such a lack of learning among laymen,
that ecclesiastics had the governance of the country
largely in their hands. The generality of men
among the upper classes deemed the labour involved
in acquiring knowledge unfit for gentlemen,
who were better employed learning to hunt, shoot,
sing, and dance. Roger Ascham reproaches the
young gentlemen of England for their sloth in learning,
and holds up for imitation the Virgin <span class="locked">Queen&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“whose example if the rest of our nobilitie would follow,
then might England bee for learning and wisdome in
nobilitie a spectacle to all the world beside.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
It was otherwise with women. They toiled
over Latin and Greek, frequently in manuscript,
for there were not many printed books in those
languages; no classics had issued from Caxton’s
press. Hebrew was also studied, for divinity and
theology occupied a good deal of attention. A
Florentine, Petruccio Ubaldini, who visited England
in 1551, writes in his comments on social <span class="locked">life&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The rich cause their sons and daughters to learn Latin,
Greek, and Hebrew, for since this storm of heresy has
invaded the land, they hold it useful to read the Scriptures
in the original tongue.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Wotton, in his “Reflections on Antient
and Modern Learning,” <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“that no age was so productive of learned women as the
sixteenth century.” “Learning,” he says, “was so very
modish that the fair sex seemed to believe that Greek
and Latin added to their charms, and that Plato and
Aristotle untranslated were frequent ornaments of their
closets. One would think by the effects that it was a
proper way of educating them, since there are no accounts
in history of so many great women in any one age as
are to be found between the years fifteen and sixteen
hundred.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Certainly England can show a roll during that
period which is in striking contrast to the records
of the preceding and succeeding centuries. For
sound scholarship and solid acquirements, the women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
of the sixteenth century may challenge comparison
with those of any subsequent period. It was not
a time for brilliant authorship among women. The
productions of the most renowned are not such as
would be read in the present day. Latin distichs,
translations of the classics and of theological works,
orations in Greek and Latin, are not the writings
which commend themselves to posterity, but they
display a degree of erudition which was not only
remarkable for that period, but would be highly
commended in this age of university teaching and
the advancement of women along the paths of the
higher education.</p>

<p>The following verses by a sixteenth-century
writer well express the feeling of the <span class="locked">times:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Perhaps queens should not be taken as
examples, inasmuch as they possess advantages
peculiar to their position, and their acquirements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
are apt to be overstated. Henry VIII., the
Sovereign Bluebeard, showed himself admirable as
a father in at least one respect, and the care with
which his daughters were educated goes some
way towards palliating his crimes towards their
mothers. If he had not obscured his own talent
by his passions and vices, we should be better able
to appreciate the encouragement he gave to literature
and art, and his accomplishments as one of the
best-educated gentlemen of the day. The tastes
of the sovereign and the <em>personnel</em> of the court had
a more direct influence on society than at the
present time. Individual members of the nobility
who cultivated learning, did a good deal in raising
the tone of their immediate circle.</p>

<p>It may be that the excellence of the tuition
given to the Princess Mary was rather due to
Queen Catherine of Aragon, who procured, among
other tutors for her daughter, a learned countryman
of her own, Ludovicus Vives of Valencia. This
preceptor succeeded to the post held by the first
tutor of the princess, Dr. Lynacre, who died in
1524, when his pupil was six years old. During
the short time she was under his care, he drew up
a work for her on “The Rudiments of Grammar.”
There are probably few princesses now who are
handed over to men of scholarship and learning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
out of their nurses’ arms, as was the eldest daughter
of Henry VIII. After the learned Spaniard had
instructed the princess a short time, he returned
to his own country, and the king then selected
Dr. John Harman.</p>

<p>The Princess Mary was specially proficient in
Latin, for which she is commended by Erasmus,
who, always ready to fall a victim to female charms,
regarded learning as an extra embellishment.
Speaking of this period, he says, “It is pretty
enough that this sex should now at last betake itself
to the ancient languages.” Mary wrote excellent
Latin epistles, and in later years translated
Erasmus’ Paraphrase on the Gospel of St. John.
The preface to this work was written by the
Master of Eton, Udall, who, after a courtly eulogy
of the royal translator, speaks of her “over-painful
study and labour of writing,” whereby she had
“cast her weak body in a grievous and long sickness.”
The work had apparently to be completed
by other hands, as Queen Mary’s health was in so
declining a condition. She also wrote prayers and
meditations.</p>

<p>Elizabeth shone more as a linguist. She is said
to have been very conversant with Latin, French,
and Italian; to have had some knowledge of Greek
when quite a young girl; and at twelve years of age,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
to have translated a series of Prayers and Meditations
from English into Latin, French, and Italian.
Her first instructor was Lady Champernon, a lady
noted for her accomplishments. With Roger
Ascham, she read the classics; with Dr. Grindal,
Professor of Divinity, she studied theology; and,
after she came to the throne, pursued her studies
with great diligence. Latin she both spoke and
wrote with ease and grace. In Italian she was
instructed by Signore Castiglioni. Greek and
Latin she was accustomed to have read to her by
Sir Henry Savil and Sir John Fortescue. She was
a great student of Plato, Aristotle, and Xenophon;
one of Xenophon’s Dialogues she translated and
published, and translated two Orations of Isocrates
from Greek into Latin.</p>

<p>Lady Jane Grey is another notable example of
learning and scholarship. Fox writes of <span class="locked">her&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If her fortune had been as good as her bringing up,
joyned with fineness of wit, undoubtedly she might have
seemed comparable, not only to the house of the Vespasians,
Sempronians, and mother of the Grachies; yea, to any
other women besides that deserveth high praise for their
singular learning; but also to the University men, who
have taken many degrees of the Schools.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Lady Jane Grey’s short and troublous life was
lightened and cheered by study. Roger Ascham<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
commended her facility in Greek composition. Her
studies were very extensive, for Sir Thomas
Chaloner said of her that she was well versed in
Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, French, and Italian.</p>

<p>None of these royal ladies were destitute of
lighter accomplishments. Elizabeth, as is well
known, was a very graceful dancer, and could sing
and play exceedingly well; Lady Jane Grey was
a musician, and clever at needlework.</p>

<p>But it was not royal ladies alone who were
celebrated for their learning in the sixteenth century.
The three daughters of Sir Anthony Coke,
preceptor to Edward VI., were as accomplished as
Queen Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey, and attracted
the attention of the great men of the age.
The eldest married Lord Burleigh, the Treasurer;
the second, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of
the Great Seal, and became the mother of the celebrated
Francis Bacon; the third became wife to
Lord John Russell, after the death of her first
husband, Sir Philip Hoby. Sir Anthony was a
father much in advance of his time. He considered
that women should be educated on the same lines
as men, and that they were quite as capable of
acquiring knowledge. So he imparted to his clever
daughters the lessons he gave to the precocious
boy-king, Edward VI.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is,” says Lloyd,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> “the happiness of foreigners that
their vocations are suited to their natures, and that their
education seconds their inclination, and both byass and
ground do wonders. It is to the unhappiness of Englishmen
that they are bred rather according to their estates than
their temper; and great parts have been lost, while their
calling drew one away and their genius another.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir Anthony seems to have known how to suit
his children’s education to their “temper,” which
was keenly studious. He was excessively careful
to set them a good example. “My example is
your inheritance, and my life is your portion,” he
wrote to his eldest daughter. All his daughters
were good classical scholars, could correspond in
Greek, and were excellent translators.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More’s daughters were educated in
a similar way. Margaret, wife of William Roper
and her father’s favourite, is the most celebrated;
but all were clever, studious women, not content
with light and easy studies, but attaining great
proficiency in abstruse subjects.</p>

<p>Jane Countess of Westmoreland, whose father
was the famous Fox the martyrologist, was said
to be able to bear comparison with the greatest
scholars of the age. The three daughters of
Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, were much
distinguished for their Latin distichs, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
said of them that if Orpheus could have heard
them he would have become their scholar.</p>

<p>Mary Sidney, afterwards Countess of Pembroke,
sister of the famous Sir Philip Sidney, was one
of the most intellectual women of her age. In
the retirement of the fine old family mansion at
Penshurst Place, Kent, she passed a studious,
happy girlhood. The companionship of her gifted
brother, and association with such men as the
poet Spenser, no doubt fostered her innate love
of learning. By the great poet she has been
celebrated <span class="locked">as&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“The gentlest shepherdess that liv’d that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And most resembling in shape and spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her brother dear.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Together with her brother she wrote a version
of the Psalms, and on her own account a poem
in celebration of Queen Elizabeth. As a centre
of intellectual thought and literary life, Mary
Sidney, when, in 1576, she became the wife of
Henry Earl of Pembroke, and mistress of his
establishment at Wilton, may be compared with
Lady Holland or Lady Blessington. Poets and
statesmen gathered at her hospitable board, for
at Wilton Place a stately magnificence was maintained.
Had the Countess of Pembroke been
merely a lady of rank, she would not have left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
her mark on an age when there were so many
illustrious names. But her cultivation of mind
made her the fit companion of the greatest
intellects of the day. It is no small thing to
have entertained Shakespeare, to have had Ben
Jonson as a familiar guest, besides lesser poets
such as Massinger and Daniel, a poet laureate
of Elizabethan days, who was a great admirer of
her talents. Sir Philip Sidney was much attached
to his distinguished sister, to whom he dedicated
his “Arcadia.” It was a grief to both that in
after-life they were so much separated. Dr.
Donne, another poet, but more eminent as a
divine, was a friend whom Mary Sidney much
esteemed. It was less for what she did than for
what she was that Mary Sidney is celebrated.
Her great nobility of character made her pre-eminent,
and her influence on her contemporaries
was very marked.</p>

<p>There was no affectation of ignorance among
the learned women of the sixteenth century.
Learning among women was held in esteem. It
was not thought unfeminine to speak good Latin,
write correct Greek, or translate from Hebrew.
Unusual and extraordinary it was undoubtedly
deemed for women to show fine scholarship, but
it was an unusual and extraordinary merit. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
absurd notion that the acquisition of knowledge,
or intellectual ability, are things to be ashamed
of, was one of the base products of eighteenth-century
sentimentalism.</p>

<p>When we think of the great difficulties in the
way of learning in the sixteenth century, we cannot
but wonder at the assiduity and patience of the
scholars of that period, both men and women.
There were no primers, exercise-books, or well-printed
dictionaries of the classical languages into
English. Grammars were scarce, and were sometimes
composed by the tutors for their pupils.
There were no carefully prepared passages for
translation with notes and explanations. The
scholar had to go straight to the original, and
ferret out the meaning unaided. Latin was the
common medium of communication between scholars
and the polite world generally. At a time when
every one with any pretensions to education understood
Latin, the standard of good scholarship must
have been fairly high, and when we find the
daughters of Sir Anthony Coke and Sir Thomas
More, and other ladies, commended for their pure
Latin, we feel that the encomium was well deserved,
as a moderate degree of proficiency would not
have attracted notice.</p>

<p>The learned ladies of the sixteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
possessed the advantage of having their attention
concentrated on a few subjects. French and
Italian were commonly learned by the daughters
of the nobility, and these comparatively easy
studies were facilitated by the constant application
to the classics. Music ranked with dancing and
ornamental needlework as an accomplishment. It
was a fashionable study for both sexes among the
highest classes. Italy then was to England, in
musical matters, what Germany has since become;
but there were also English composers, among
whom Henry VIII. himself was included. Vocal
music was extremely popular, instrumental music
being in a comparatively elementary stage. The
English in the sixteenth century seem to have
been a very music-loving people; Erasmus says,
“The most accomplished in the skill of music of
any people;” and the degree to which it was
practised at court in the time of Henry VIII.
may be guessed from the fact that singing at
sight was then a common accomplishment among
the courtiers. Counterpoint was studied by those
who aspired to be connoisseurs; but musical literature
was very scanty, and the repertorium available
for the lute and the mandoline, the clavichord, or
the virginals, must soon have been exhausted.</p>

<p>There was less arithmetic, history, and geography<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
taught than is now imparted in board schools to
the poorest. The curriculum for a lady of rank
did not include many things which have now become
matters of common knowledge among the
children of the working classes. On the other
hand, the education, if narrow according to modern
ideas, was thorough, and without the stimulus of
college life, of competitive examinations, without the
prospect of rewards and honours in the shape of
degrees, the attainments of women in the sixteenth
century in the subjects to which they had access, were
of a high order, and their knowledge of the classics
was more intimate and exact than that produced
by the higher education of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Learning was necessarily confined to women of
position and wealth, who could afford the luxury
of private tutors and the equally great luxury of
books. There were, doubtless, here and there
families of lower rank whose daughters would have
borne favourable comparison with the titled ladies
who are so conspicuous. But wide diffusion of
knowledge and a high standard of education among
women generally, if it existed, did not excite notice
among contemporary writers as did the studious
habits of the upper classes. Udall, the master
of Eton in Queen Mary’s reign, speaks with admiration
<span class="locked">of&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“the great number of noble women at that time in
England, not only given to the study of human sciences
and strange tongues, but also so thoroughly expert in
Holy Scriptures that they were able to compare with the
best writers, as well in enditeing and penning of godly
and fruitful treatises to the instruction and edifying of
realmes in the knowledge of God, as also in translating
good books out of Latin or Greek into English for the use
and commodity of such as are rude and ignorant of the
said tongues. It was now no news in England to see
young damsels in noble houses and in the courts of
princes, instead of cards and other instruments of idle
trifling, to have continually in their hands either psalms,
homilies, and other devout meditations, or else Paul’s
Epistles or some book of Holy Scripture matters, and as
familiarly both to read and reason thereof in Greek, Latin,
French, or Italian as in English. It was now a common
thing to see young virgins so trained in the study of good
letters that they willingly set all other vain pastimes at
naught for learning sake. It was now no news at all to see
Queens and ladies of most high estate and progeny, instead
of courtly dalliance, to embrace virtuous exercises of
reading and writing, and with most earnest study both
early and late to apply themselves to the acquiring of
knowledge, as well in all other liberal artes and disciplines,
as also most especially of God and his holy word.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Erasmus, in one of his discourses, gives us a
glimpse of the view taken by the Church of female
scholarship. He introduces a conversation between
an abbot and a learned woman. The abbot contends
that women would never be kept in subjection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
if they were learned. They would become wiser
than men. “Therefore it is a wicked mischievous
thing to revive the ancient custom of educating
them.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>Taken in conjunction with a remark of Erasmus
in one of his letters, it is doubtful whether after
all he did not deem learning wasted on women.
Describing Sir Thomas More, he says, “He is
wise with the wise, and jests with fools&mdash;with
women especially, and his wife among them.”</p>

<p>A more liberal view was taken by Richard
Mulcaster, the master of the school founded by the
Merchant Taylors’ Company in 1561, in the parish
of St. Lawrence Poultney. He <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I set not young maidens to public Grammar Scholes,
a thing not used in my countrie, I send them not to the
universities, having no president thereof in my countrie, I
allow them learning with distinction in degrees, with
difference of their calling, with respect to their endes
wherefore they learne, wherin my countrie confirmeth my
opinion. We see young maidens be taught to read and
write, and can do both with praise; we have them sing and
playe: and both passing well, we know that they learne
the best, and finest of our learned languages, to the
admiration of all men. For the daiely spoken tongues
and of best reputation in our time who so shall denie that
they may not compare even with our kinde in the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
degree.... Nay, do we not see in our country some of
that sex so excellently well trained and so rarely qualified
either for the tongues themselves or for the matter in the
tongues: as they may be opposed by way of comparison
if not preferred as beyond comparison even to the best
Romaine or Greekish paragones be they never so much
praised: to the Germaine or French gentlewymen by late
writers so wel liked: to the Italian ladies who dare write
themselves and deserve fame for so doing? whose excellencie
is so geason as they be rather wonders to gaze at
then presidentes to follow. And is that to be called in
question which we both dayly see in many and wonder at
in some? I dare be bould, therefore, to admit yong
maidens to learne, seeing my countrie gives me leave and
her custome standes for me. Their natural towardnesse
should make us see them well brought up.... Some
Timon will say, what should wymend with learning?
Such a churlish carper will never picke out the best,
but be alway ready to blame the worst. If all men
used all pointes of learning well, we had some reason to
alledge against wymen, but seeing misuse is commonly
both the kinds, why blame we their infirmitie whence we
free not ourselves.... And is not, think you, a young
gentlewoman thoroughly furnished which can reade plainly
and distinctly, write faire and swiftly, sing cleare and
sweetly, play wel and finely, understand and speake the
learned languages, and the tongues also which the time
most embraseth with some logicall helpe to chop and some
rhetoricke to brave.... Or is it likely that her children
shalbe eare a whit the worse brought up if she be a Lœlia,
an Hortensia or a Cornelia, which were so endued and
noted for so doing.... The places wherein they learne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
be either publike if they go forth to the elementaire schole
or private if they be taught at home. The teacher either
of their owne sex or of ours.... In teachers their owne
sex were fittest in some respectes, but ours frame them
best and with good regard to some circumstances will
bring them up excellently well.”</p></blockquote>

Makins&mdash;The Duchess of Newcastle&mdash;General estimation

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">After</span> the sixteenth century the lamp of learning
flickered a good deal. The air was very unsteady;
winds came blowing from all quarters. There
was the adverse gale of the Civil War, which was
a great peril to progress. And what followed was
almost equally disastrous. Neither the austerity
of the Puritans nor the licence of the Royalists was
favourable to the arts of peace, and when political
passions were dividing the country, it was no time
for poring over books, and holding commune with
philosophers and poets. Religious enthusiasm
thrives by opposition, and the purity of principle
has often been maintained by persecution. It is
otherwise with learning and culture. They need
encouragement and tending in order to blossom and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
bear fruit. From a variety of causes, a period of
reaction set in after the vigorous and healthy
awakening in the time of the Tudors. The fault
of the seventeenth century was its lack of earnestness
about intellectual matters. It combined all
the faults of all the ages&mdash;laxity of morals, indifference
to high aims, combined with religious
fanaticism and a lack of appreciation of knowledge
and learning. The Puritan party were so much
engrossed with religious dogmas, that they had
little time to spend on purely secular thought,
which they considered a frivolous if not a sinful
exercise. The Royalists loved pleasure too well to
give more than passing attention to serious studies.
The period of the Restoration is thus described by
a writer in the next <span class="locked">century&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Religion which had been in vogue in the late times
was now universally discountenanced; the name of it was
hardly mentioned but with contempt, in a health or a play.
Those who observed the sabbath and scrupled profane
swearing and drinking healths were exposed under the
opprobrious names of puritans, fanaticks, presbyterians,
republicans, seditious persons.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The advantages to be derived from intellectual
liberty were not appreciated. Charles II., joking
with the Royal Society, to whom he loved to
propound insoluble problems, reflects the attitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
of the aristocracy towards science and literature.
By that time Shakespeare was considered a little
out of date and vulgar by an age of fops and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élégantes</i> who could read Wycherley without blushing.
There was a quiet cultured set, such as
Evelyn and his friends. Evelyn’s daughter Mary,
who died at the age of about nineteen, was a most
accomplished and studious girl, and shared her
father’s literary labours and enjoyments. But the
seventeenth century was not favourable to the
production of scholars. As the intellectual horizon
widened learning became less profound. Women’s
education was pursued on somewhat different lines.
There was less scholarship among the best-educated
women. We do not hear of ladies corresponding
in Greek or translating from the Hebrew. The
classics no longer held the chief place in the curriculum.
Literature was multiplying in English and
other living languages, and music and painting
were more cultivated.</p>

<p>But there was little attempt, in the seventeenth
century, to provide substitutes for what women had
lost by the dissolution of the convent schools. For
accomplishments, such as singing and dancing,
wealthy families engaged special masters&mdash;generally
French&mdash;and the domestic chaplain sometimes
acted as tutor for the more solid parts of education.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Among middle-class families, however, whose
means did not allow of private tuition, the girls came
off badly, there being very few schools of any sort,
and very scanty supplies of literature in the home.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century was a great period for
famous painters, and the presence of numerous
excellent foreign artists in England influenced the
attitude of society among the higher classes towards
art. It might have been thought that, with a
professed pedant like James I. following the learned
Queen Elizabeth, there would have been a renewed
impetus towards the profounder studies. But
James I. was deficient in real strength of character,
and was not an intellectual force. He might have
played a very fair part among a knot of schoolmen
disputing over theological points, but as a sovereign
his talents did not show to good advantage. Moreover,
he was in every way adverse to the progress
of women. He treated them as inferiors, with a
ponderous levity, and nothing was further from his
mind than giving any encouragement to the cultivation
of learning among the ladies of the court.
Under Charles I. culture would have had a fair
chance in England had not political trouble intervened,
and during the remainder of the century
society underwent a series of changes inimical to
learning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Women’s education in the seventeenth century,
among those sections of society where learning was
cultivated, seems to have taken a more feminine
tone. Accomplishments were sought after rather
than solid acquirements. There was a leaning to
lighter pursuits, to what were quaintly called
“virtues,” such as instrumental and vocal music,
dancing, and needlework. There was a dash of
fine ladyism in it all. At the same time there was
a parade of education. It was customary, among
the families of the nobility, for the daughters to
have tutors for reading and writing (which are
specified as distinct subjects, not included, as now,
under a general term), French, Latin, and perhaps
Italian. Mrs. Hutchinson tells us that she had as
many as eight tutors when she was seven years old,
but she was exceptionally well instructed.</p>

<p>Lucy Aspley, as she was then, was a child of
extraordinary abilities, of which her father was very
proud. At four years old she could read English
perfectly. Her brothers at school, finding she was
outstripping them in Latin with her tutor at home,
tried to emulate her zeal. She cared for none of
the feminine accomplishments, such as needlework
and dancing, and always preferred the company
and conversation of older people, even as a child.
With all her precocity, and in spite of the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
she was treated as the literary light of the family,
she grew up unspoiled by flattery, and developed
into one of the noblest women of her age.</p>

<p>Lady Anne Halkett, the daughter of Thomas
Murray, preceptor to Charles I., was probably
better taught than most young women of the time.
She herself lays stress on the pains bestowed upon
her education by her parents, but there is no
mention of any profound study. She had masters
for French, for writing, for dancing, and for the
practice of the lute and the virginals, and a
gentlewoman was employed to teach her needlework.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alice Thornton, who lived between 1626
and 1707, and whose family on the father’s side
was related to the Earl of Strafford, says that in
1632, while living in Ireland, she <span class="locked">had&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“the best education that Kingdome could afford, having
the advantage of societie in the sweet and chaste company
of the Earle of Strafford’s daughter, the most virtuous
Lady Anne, and the Lady Arbella Wentworth, learning
those qualities with them which my father ordered, namelie&mdash;the
French language, to write and speak the same;
singing, danceing, plaeing on the lute and theorboe;
learning such other accomplishments of working silkes,
gummework, sweetmeats, and other sutable huswifery, as
by my mother’s vertuous provision and caire, she brought
me up in what was fitt for her qualitie and my father’s
childe.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Presumably, spelling formed one of the subjects
of education; but the extremely faulty orthography
of female letter-writers, even among the cultured
classes, in the seventeenth century, points to a
haphazard method of teaching this branch of knowledge.
After making due allowance for the unsettled
state of the language, and the want of
uniformity in good authors, the letters of women
of high rank show an extraordinary licence in
orthography, which appeared to be a matter regulated
by individual fancy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Makins, writing in 1673, <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I verily think women were formerly educated in the
knowledge of arts and tongues, and by their education
many did rise to a great height in learning. Were women
thus educated now, I am confident the advantage would
be very great.” She adds, “I am very sensible it is an
ill time to set on foot this design, wherein not only learning
but vertue itself is scorn’d and neglected as pedantic
things, fit only for the vulgar.... Were a competent
number of schools erected to educate ladyes ingeniously,
methinks I see how asham’d men would be of their
ignorance, and how industrious the next generation would
be to wipe off their reproach.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most celebrated women of learning
in the early part of the century was Margaret
Lucas, afterwards Duchess of Newcastle, and she
seems to have acquired her knowledge chiefly by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
her own efforts. Sir Charles Lucas had tutors for
his daughters, but half the year the family spent
in London, enjoying all the diversions the capital
could afford, and study was not at all strictly enforced
on the girls. The Duchess wrote numerous
poems and prose works of a philosophical character,
and was, she tells us herself, a very rapid composer,
her ideas outrunning her hand. Judged by the
standard of to-day, her works seem like the voluble
outpourings of a curious fancy. Her ideas are
interesting rather as giving us a glimpse of the
thought of her day, than valuable for intrinsic
merit or freshness; but in her lifetime she was
applauded by scholars with lavish adulation, partly,
no doubt, on account of her rank. The heads of
the University of Cambridge were full of wonder
that a woman should be able to compose such
works, and many scholars from other parts wrote
in terms of respectful admiration and astonishment.
The fulsome flatteries poured into the ears of the
duchess were unworthy of their authors, but there
is no doubt that her productions appeared sufficiently
remarkable to her contemporaries. More than one
scholar to whom the duchess sent her books,
remarks on the proof her Grace has given that
women are as capable of intellectual acquirements
as men. One writes that she has confirmed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
statement of an old author, that women excel men;
and another, that she has clearly decided the
question of mental equality between the sexes.</p>

<p>In watching the evolution of women in regard
to learning, the general estimation in which learning
was held in those days has also to be noted.
Gentlemen might certainly be scholars, but scholars
were not considered gentlemen. The study of
books, more especially the writing of them, was
thought a laborious occupation unfit for those who
could sit at ease and enjoy the world.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Neither do our Nobilitie and Gentry so much affect
the study of good Letters as in former times,” wrote Henry
Peachman in 1638, “loving better the <em>Active</em> than the
<em>Contemplative</em> part of <em>Knowledge</em>, which in times of the
Monasteries was more esteemed and doated on than now.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One scholar, writing to the Duchess of Newcastle,
speaks of authorship as an “inferior employment”
unmeet for the rank and qualities of a lady
like her Grace.</p>

<p>Another element that has to be taken into
account was the change which came over social life
in the upper ranks of society. There was more
going to and fro between London and the country.
Formerly, people stayed quietly in their own homes
from one year to another. But as travelling became
more general, the custom grew up for families of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
rank and wealth to spend half the year in London&mdash;the
winter half&mdash;and the other half in the country.
This greatly altered the conditions of family life.
The season in London was a period for amusement,
for seeing sights, receiving company, and going to
balls and masks. There was not much time for
serious studies, and the more frequent intercourse
with society encouraged young daughters in a
family to cultivate such accomplishments as music
and dancing, to study French and Italian rather
than Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and to generally
avoid subjects that demanded much patience and
assiduity. There were women clever and brilliant,
and noted for their versatile talents. Lucy Harrington,
Countess of Bedford, was one of these.
She was certainly a good Latin scholar, had many
accomplishments, and was a friend and favourite
of the learned men of the day. Lady Wroth,
niece of the celebrated Mary Sidney, Countess
of Pembroke, was another patroness of the learned,
and seems to have inherited some of her aunt’s
ability. But we have to wait until the middle of
the next century before we find any coterie of
learned women, comparable with the scholars and
students of the Tudor Period.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IVb"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="subhead">GLIMPSES AT GREAT LADIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Changes in domestic life&mdash;Lady Elizabeth Howard’s household at
Naworth Castle&mdash;The Countess of Sunderland&mdash;The Belvoir
Castle family&mdash;The Countess of Salisbury’s suit&mdash;The Countess
of Pembroke and the “boon hen”&mdash;Bess of Hardwicke&mdash;Court
ladies&mdash;Lady Brilliana Harley&mdash;Lady Lucas&mdash;Match-making&mdash;Seizure
of an heiress.</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">When</span> with the Renaissance old habits of thought
changed, the horizon of domestic life was enlarged.
The great lady appears in a different light. She is
no longer merely the loaf-giver and spinster, sitting
in the shadow of her lord. With increased means of
comfort, with the spread of knowledge, life became
much more complex. The conditions of life did not
permit that the great lady should herself take such
an active part in all the domestic industries and arts
which were carried on in a large household. She
had other occupations. It was the steward who
saw to the providing of the household stuff, to the
payment of servants’ wages, to the almsgiving, and
even to the furnishing of the wardrobe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Although needlework still filled a large and
honoured place in the lives of women of high
station, it was rather an exercise than a necessity.
Girls were taught to spin, to sew, and to embroider;
a great lady might assist in the devising and
making of her own apparel, but more commonly
she left it in the hands of the tailors and sempstresses,
and when she busied herself with plain
needlework it was for the poor. Great families in
the country would, for ordinary purposes, employ
a local tailor, who would come and do his work at
the house. Lady Elizabeth Howard, of Naworth
Castle, who lived in the seventeenth century, and
was one of the greatest ladies of her time, with a
rent-roll of £1040 a year of the money of that
period, was satisfied to have the plain serge gowns
which she wore for common use made by the
country tailor. The flax for the household linen
was spun at home and sent to a country weaver.
Lady Elizabeth was a woman of simple tastes, too
much engrossed with practical affairs to care for
display.</p>

<p>The curious commissions which great ladies in
the seventeenth century gave to their male friends
abroad, and the presents exchanged among members
of noble families, show that many ordinary articles
now in domestic use were then luxuries. In 1679,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
or thereabouts, the Countess of Sunderland writes
to her brother, Mr. Sidney, envoy to Holland, in
the following <span class="locked">terms:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I desire you to lay out £20 for me in Dutch wax
candles, which my Lady Temple says are very good.
I would have them four to the pound, three parts, and the
fourth part six to the pound; and some tea if you love
me, for the last you gave was admirable.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One would like to know what quantity of
candles Mr. Sidney was able to buy for £20, which
represented a much larger sum then, and whether
the countess kept a private cupboard in which to
lock up these precious articles.</p>

<p>Lady Chaworth, in 1676, writes to her brother,
Lord Roos, at Belvoir Castle, to thank him, among
other things, for a present of some oat-cakes and
a pie. She sends him in return a peck of chestnuts
and five pounds of vermicelli, some portion of
which, she says, is of the same quality as that
supplied to the king, who had a consignment of
three hundred pounds’ weight. This seems a prodigious
quantity, when it is remembered that
farinaceous foods were not a staple article of diet.
She also sends Lord Roos comfits, which she is
pleased to hear that he likes, for she tells <span class="locked">him&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There is four pound of them, and made fresh for
you of the purest sugar, though I gave a little more
for them.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Lord Roos had a sweet tooth, evidently, and it
is to be hoped as sound as sweet, for our ancestors
took very little care of their teeth. In 1650 we
find Sir Ralph Verney sending to a friend at
Florence a present of “teeth-brushes and boxes,”
which were new-fangled Parisian articles, described
by Sir Ralph as “inconsiderable toyes.”</p>

<p>As manners improved there was less separation
of the sexes and more family life. In the absence
of the husband, the lady of the manor, as she
may still be called, for she often enriched her lord
with the broad acres of her own inheritance, was
much occupied with the management of the estate.
The Lady Elizabeth Howard, already mentioned,
who brought as her dowry the extensive Dacres
property about which there was so much litigation,
always attended to the business relating to the
manors during her husband’s absences in London,
whither she herself rarely travelled. Anne,
daughter of the second Duke of Norfolk, being
burdened with a husband very deficient in mental
and physical parts&mdash;“Little John of Campes,” fourteenth
Earl of Oxford&mdash;took the control into her
own hands of all the affairs of the household and
the estate. She corresponded about her difficulties
with Wolsey, who advised her to return with her
husband to her father’s roof, paying the duke a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
reasonable sum for the accommodation. The
countess, who had no children to aid her, was
sorely beset, after her husband’s death, by rapacious
relatives, whom during his lifetime she had contrived
to keep at bay. She complains that her
park, and even her house, were broken into and
her servants maltreated, and that, although the
justices issued a writ against the offenders, it
was not put into execution, and “doth nothing
avail.”</p>

<p>Anne Countess of Warwick, wife of the king-maker,
was shamefully robbed of her possessions
by her sons-in-law, the Dukes of Clarence and
Gloucester, and was obliged, she tells us, to write
many letters with her own hand, in the absence
of clerks. She finally got back all her property
by Act of Parliament, but she did not keep it.
She was either cajoled out of her estates, or her
attachment to the king, whom her husband had
assisted to the throne, was all-powerful; but,
whatever the cause, she passed over one hundred
and eighteen manors by private compact to
Henry VII.</p>

<p>Another great lady, Margaret Countess of
Salisbury, grand-daughter of Richard Earl of
Salisbury, had a great deal of trouble in keeping
a hold of her possessions. She was engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
a suit against Henry VIII. to recover a yearly
income of 5000 marks from certain of her manors.
The rapacious king appears to have yielded, and
she afterwards generously presented him with a
year’s revenue as an aid in the prosecution of
his wars. A revengeful lover whom she had
rejected did his utmost to deprive her of her
estates by filling the king’s mind with suspicions
as to the legality of her claim. She also suffered
much annoyance from marauders, who broke into
her domain and cut down her woods.</p>

<p>Women of property were very liable to be
preyed upon by grasping sovereigns and unscrupulous
ministers like Wolsey, who actually led
Elizabeth Dowager Countess of Oxford to endanger
the cliff at Harwich, which formed part
of her estate, in order to supply him with stone
for his new college at Ipswich.</p>

<p>The famous Anne Clifford, Countess of Pembroke
and Dorset, after struggling with James I.
over her inheritance, found plenty of occupation
in going to law with her numerous tenants, in
building, in causing “bounds to be ridden,” and
courts to be kept in her several manors. She
seems to have divided her time pretty equally
among her northern castles, travelling in state in
a coach and six from Pendragon Castle to Appleby,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
and thence to Skypton and Brougham. She
describes her tenants as frequently obstinate and
refractory, and evictions were sometimes necessary.
However, in the midst of these unpleasant processes,
she was building brew-houses, bake-houses,
and stables, repairing decayed mansions which had
not been inhabited for years, and establishing fresh
almshouses for the poor.</p>

<p>The Countess was very tenacious of her rights,
and refused to yield at any cost when it was a
question of principle. On one occasion a rich
clothier of Halifax, one of her tenants, would
not pay the one “boon hen” which traditional
custom demanded from the holder of a certain
tenement. The Countess took the case to the
law courts and recovered the hen, but at a cost
of £200 to herself and the same amount to her
adversary. She much resented interference, and
when Cromwell sent down a commission to compose
some differences between herself and her
people, she politely but firmly refused to let the
commissioners deal with the matter at all, saying
she preferred to leave it to the decision of the
law. As a landlord she did all she could for her
county by buying everything from her neighbours
and tenants, very rarely sending to London or
elsewhere as other great folk in the country were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
in the habit of doing, and as a mistress she was
very kind to her attendants.</p>

<p>Anne Clifford was not singular in her taste
for litigation. Walter Cary writes, in <span class="locked">1626&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“These three which have turned things upside down
and strangely altered our estate are suits of law, suits
of apparel, and drunkennesse.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">With regard to the last two particulars, Anne
Clifford was certainly blameless, and though she
moved about in her own part of the country, she
did not waste her substance on journeys to London,
as Cary complained the country gentlemen were
in the habit of doing. In former times, he says
men</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“did not long for their neighbours’ land, neither sold
of their own, but keeping good hospitality and plainly
ever attired were very rich.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The celebrated Bess of Hardwicke, who made
her first marriage in 1532, and was a widow for
the fourth time in 1609, after the death of George
Earl of Shrewsbury, spent much of her time and
money in building. It was a passion with her to
repair and to erect magnificent piles. She persuaded
her second husband, Sir William Cavendish, to
begin the building of Chatsworth, which she completed
after his death. Near the old home of her
childhood she erected a second Hardwicke Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
and also built a mansion at Oldcote. She has been
described by her greatest detractor, Lodge, as “a
builder, a buyer, a seller of estates, a money-lender,
a farmer, and a merchant of lead, coals, and timber.”
She also built herself a magnificent mural monument
in All Saints’ Church, Derby. It was her
fourth husband, the Earl of Shrewsbury, who had
for a long time the custody of Mary Queen of
Scots, of whose supposed influence “Bess” was so
jealous. A significant remark which she made
to Queen Elizabeth caused the Earl to be deprived
of his fair charge.</p>

<p>The great lady in her own home appears to
far better advantage than her compeers at court,
who are thus caustically described by a writer of
the second half of the sixteenth <span class="locked">century&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The women of the Courte have also their vices. For
alwaie we see manie endowed with goodly giftes of the
body, fayre, preatie, handsome and comely. Moreover,
richly attired in purple, golde, jewels, and ryches: but all
men cannot see what filthy monsters do often lurke under
those faire skinnes....</p>

<p>“They have mouthes armed for all kindes of clattering
trifles with which they utter idle and foolish communication,
and oftentimes displeasant to those that be compelled
to heare them. For what shoulde we thinke them to
speake emong themselves so many howers, but foolish and
idle thinges: as how the heare should be dressed, how
it should be kembed, how the heare should be coloured,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
how the face should be rubbed, after what facion the
garment should be playted, and with what pompe they
should go, rise and sit, and what attire they should weare,
to what persons they should geve place, with how many
bowinges salute, what women, and whome they should
kisse or not kisse, what women ought to ride upon an asse,
horse, seate and be carried in a chariote or couche: what
women maie weare golde, pearle, corall, chaines, ringes
hanginge at their eares, bracelets, ringes and tablets and
other trifles of Semiramis lawes.</p>

<p>“There be also ancient matrons whiche tell how many
wowers they have had, how many giftes thei have receaved,
with how many flatteringe wordes they have benne wowed:
this woman talketh of him whome she loveth, that woman
cannot skantly forbeare to speake of him whom she hateth,
and every one thinketh that she speaketh with the admiration
of other women, sometimes they maintaine talke with
fonde quippes or very impudent lies. There wante not
emonge them cruell hatredes and eger brawlinges, malicious
detractions, backebitinges, false accusations and whatsoever
be the vices of a naughtie tongue.”</p></blockquote>

<p>All the blame is laid upon the wives by this
moralist, and the husbands he depicts as long-suffering
<span class="locked">martyrs&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“O how sorrowful do thei make their good husbandes
when continually they objecte to them their lineage, dowrie,
beautie, and other mens mariages, and with scoldinge and
tauntinge do weary their husbandes, they alwaies lamente,
whilst they dispise housholde and temperate fare, and twite
their husbandes with the courtly excesse and being enured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
in pleasant fantasies and gloriouse ostentation do consume
theire riches upon superfluous ornamentes, they bring houses
by ruine, sometimes they enforce their miserable husbandes
to dishonest and naughtie gaines.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Lady Brilliana Harley, who lived through the
Civil War, stands out in pleasing contrast as a quiet
domestic character, a model housewife. While her
husband, who was actively engaged on the Parliamentarian
side, was away from home, she watched
over the family interests with the greatest solicitude,
and seems to have been her own housekeeper and
man of business. At one time she was busy with
repairs and alterations to the house, and mentions
having to pay five shillings a day to plumbers and
five shillings a hundred to them in addition for
“casting lead.” She was constantly sending
provisions to her son at Oxford University, and
sometimes to her husband, and describes with such
minuteness the contents of the pies that one feels
she must have assisted in the making. Very big
pies they were; a couple of chickens would be
added as a kind of make-weight, and one of these
pasties contained two whole turkeys. As this was
a present to her son at Oxford, it may be supposed
that Lady Brilliana had hospitable thoughts for the
other undergraduates.</p>

<p>Lady Lucas, mother of the learned Duchess of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Newcastle, was “very skilful in leases, setting of
lands, court keeping, ordering of stewards”&mdash;useful
talents, seeing that she married a rich husband.
After the Civil War, her daughter, who presumably
inherited some portion of the property which her
mother had so carefully guarded, was reduced to
great straits. The Duke of Newcastle’s estates
were sold by the Commonwealth, and, the Duke
being made a delinquent, his wife was deprived of
the usual allowances. She retired to Antwerp,
but returned to England and spent a year and a
half unsuccessfully trying to obtain some compensation.
However, as her chief interest lay in
literature, the absence of outward show in her
surroundings did not greatly affect her, and she bore
her losses very philosophically.</p>

<p>Dependent as has been woman’s position up to
the present century, in all the important relations of
life, she has always been called upon as a great lady
to bear responsibilities and fulfil duties of no light
character. In mediæval times they were chiefly
domestic, but none the less weighty, for the health
and comfort of the household depended upon the
“bread-giver.” As social conditions altered, we see
the great lady extending her duties outside her own
walls, and engaged in what is almost public work.
She is frequently drawn into the current of political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
life, and her position is considerably affected by the
religious changes in the country. She comes into
prominence as an independent actor in the drama
of history, forced oftentimes to stand alone, and
beset by trials and cares which only belong to those
who have much to lose. In times when the power
of the sovereign was more absolute, the position of
persons of property and influence, whether men or
women, was less secure, and they were liable to
a rise or fall of fortune according to the caprice of
the monarch. A great lady in the present day
could not be brought into collision with the
sovereign over the rights of property, as were
Margaret Countess of Salisbury and Anne Countess
of Pembroke. There is no longer that intimate
personal relation between the sovereign and the
subject.</p>

<p>The hereditary right of succession to titles of
nobility granted by the Norman kings, without distinction
of sex, greatly affected the position of women
among the higher classes. They acquired a dignity
and importance in the eyes of rulers which otherwise
they would not have possessed. An heiress
who could convey a title and lands to her husband
was a personage to be reckoned with and considered.
There are numerous instances of men
claiming titles and privileges by virtue of their wives’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
position. Richard Neville gained the earldom of
Salisbury, and his son that of Warwick, by marriage
with heiresses. But while a woman could thus
confer advantages of a substantial kind upon her
husband, she still lacked that control over her own
property which characterized the position of a wife
until recent times. Women’s marriage portions were
denounced by writers in the seventeenth century as
the cause of wedded misery and <span class="locked">sin&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“men and women, being byassed by interest in marriage
and not having that firm friendship and love for each
other, do seek for a greater happiness abroad.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Marriages were arranged among people of good
estate and condition with a very frank display of
mercenary motives. For instance, we find various
relatives of the excellent Sir Ralph Verney anxiously
engaged in helping him, after his wife’s
death in 1656, to find an heiress for his son. One,
Mrs. Sherrard, writes that she has discovered a
lady whom she thinks would be a suitable mate
for young Edmund <span class="locked">Verney&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Her father will give her five thousand pounds, and
hath but on dafter more, and she is sickly and never licke
to mary, and if not shee will have more than enouf, for it
is beleved that her father is worth above thirty thousand
pounds, and dooth daily incres in welth. I hear shee is
not but of a very good disposition.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Another relative <span class="locked">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Here is a match for your sown, Mr. Wilson’s daughter
of Surrey (formerly a cittizen) that I think worthy yur
consideration; they offer £5,500.”</p></blockquote>

<p>People used plain language in the seventeenth
century, and when a match was proposed it was in
out-spoken terms. The young people were treated
as pawns by their respective guardians, and instead
of lawyers settling matters, it was the parents who
wrangled over property and drove bargains. There
is little difference in this respect between the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, and the following
letter of Lady Katherine Berkeley, though it
belongs to the Tudor period, might well have
been written a hundred years later. Lady Berkeley
was wife of Henry, first Lord Berkeley, to whom
she was married in the reign of Queen Mary. She
is writing to her confidential man of business, John
Smyth, about her son’s marriage.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have received your letter, but doe not think good to
show it to my lord least hee should leave his suits in law
whereof I have soe good hope to a dangerous event, with
an imagination that out of his own judgment hee could
conclude a profitable end upon the overture now made.
These imaginations you know have not produced the best
effects. If the motion for my son’s marriage proceed I
doe then believe the politicke lady will bee glad to come to
an end; yet doe I fear her proffer rather proceeds of policy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
then from sincere meaning. I have observed that when
she sees anything bending to our good, then shee proffers
an agreement, and yet proceeds in lawe with all extremity.”
She concludes by requesting that “whosoever intends to
match with my son shall only deale with my lord and
mee.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This really meant with Lady Katherine herself.
She had but a poor opinion of her husband’s ability,
and was exceedingly anxious to keep him by her
side. She does not at all approve of his going to
London by himself to negotiate marriages or any
other business, being confident that he will only
lose his money.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At London younge crafty courtiers will lay baits
which will bee swallowed with danger; the safest way is
to keep him from London.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Many romances have been written on the carrying
off of heiresses by bold suitors. During the
Commonwealth some effort was made to prevent
scandals of this kind and save women from being
married against their will. There was one case
that excited a good deal of attention in October,
1649. Mistress Jane Puckeringe was abducted
from Greenwich Park while walking with her
maids, close to her own house. She was the
daughter of Sir Thomas Puckeringe, and an
heiress. The abductors were some people named<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Walsh, a Worcestershire family. Joseph Walsh
and his friends seized Mistress Puckeringe, mounted
her on a horse, and, having a hoy in readiness,
went across to Dunkirk. Thence they went to
Nieuport, in Flanders, and shut her up in a religious
house. As soon as the affair was made known,
there was a great stir in the official world, and
warrants were issued for her recovery and for the
punishment of Walsh and his companions. Walsh
maintained that there had been a marriage ceremony
performed. The Spanish ambassador was
appealed to, and steps taken that every one concerned
in the affair might be arrested. The Council
of State in England sent over a Mrs. Magdalen
Smith, armed with letters of authority, to seek for
the lost heiress and bring her back; and a ship
was ordered to go to Nieuport to be in readiness to
receive her. The English agent at Brussels, Peter
Thelwell, was told to turn his attention to the
matter. Still, the winter sped away and Mistress
Puckeringe was not restored to her friends, so in
March the Council of State again took action and
wrote to the archduke. Mr. Peter Thelwell, on his
own responsibility, appealed to Prince Charles, which
was distasteful to the officers of the Commonwealth,
who were not disposed to have any dealings with
the Cavalier party, and at last in June, some eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
months after the abduction, the lady was sent
back to England in a man-of-war, and her captors
were surrendered to the English authorities and
indicted for felony, the supposed marriage being
set aside.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">The</span> Civil War had raised up two parties in
England, divided as much upon ethics as upon
politics. With the extremists on either side,
women fared badly. They were between two
camps, both equally noxious in their way&mdash;the
libertines and the ascetics.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Under the Commonwealth society assumed a new and
stern aspect. Women were in disgrace; it was everywhere
declared from the pulpit that woman caused man’s
expulsion from Paradise, and ought to be shunned by
Christians as one of the greatest temptations of Satan.
‘Man,’ said they, ‘is conceived in sin and brought forth
in iniquity; it was his complacency to women that caused
his first debasement; let man not therefore glory in his
shame; let him not worship the fountain of his corruption.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Learning and accomplishments were alike discouraged,
and women confined to a knowledge of cooking, family
medicines, and the unintelligible theological discussions
of the day.”</p></blockquote>

<p>If Cromwell’s “Saints,” with their deadly
hatred of Roman Catholicism, had been told that
their views coincided with certain portions of the
early teaching of the abhorred Church, they would
have vehemently repelled the accusation. But the
Puritans, in their revolt against beauty and pleasure,
in their cramped conception and distorted views
of the position of women, were only following the
lead of the Fathers and the monks of the fourth
century, who made of Christianity a revolting and
immoral form of asceticism.</p>

<p>A kind of moral dislocation was going on,
forming a canker in social life. With the excesses
of the court on the one hand and the austerities of
the Puritans on the other, there was a constant
interaction going on, each party goading the other
into greater extremes. The deterioration of moral
tone on the one side, and the perversion of thought
on the other, affected the national life injuriously,
and retarded the intellectual progress of women.</p>

<p>There was, to begin with, an unstable throne.
The Stuarts were weak rulers, and the people felt
the relaxing of the strong hand of the Tudors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
James I., untrained for his position, was a very undesirable
sovereign, and earned for himself ridicule
and dislike. One of his peculiarities was to affect
a great contempt for women, and to scoff at men
who treated them with respect. No wonder that
he was held in abhorrence by the court ladies, and
that there were loud complaints of his Majesty’s
want of gallantry.</p>

<p>Then there was a tendency to listlessness, and
especially to mental inertia, after the revival of
learning in the sixteenth century. The tension
could not be sustained. And there were special
difficulties arising from the circumstances of the
time. The destruction of so many seats of learning
by the dissolution of the Religious Houses was a
blow to education. Nothing had arisen to take the
place of the monastic schools. How little provision
there was may be judged by the following remarks,
made on the establishment of a school for the
sons of gentlemen in the second half of the seventeenth
<span class="locked">century:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is sufficiently known that the subjects of his
Majestie’s dominions have, naturally, as noble minds and
as able bodies as any nation of the earth, and therefore
deserve all accommodations for the advancing of them
either in speculation or action. Neverthelesse such hath
been the neglect or undervalueing of ourselves and our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
own abilities, and over-valueing of forreigne teachers, that
hitherto no such places for the education and trayning up
of our own young nobilitie and gentrie in the practise of
arms and arts have been instituted here in England as are
in Italy, France, and Germany, but that by a chargeable
and sometimes an unfortunate experience we, to our own
losse and disgrace, doe finde the noble and generous
youth of this kingdome is sent beyond the seas, to learn
such things at excessive rates, from strangers abroad,
wherein they might be as well, and with lesse expense and
danger, instructed here at home.”</p></blockquote>

<p>If little attention were given to providing for
the training of youths, still less was paid to that
of girls, for whom there was not the compensation
of being “sent beyond the seas.” Even for a gentleman’s
daughters it was not thought necessary that
they should learn anything thoroughly except
housewifery.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Let them learne plaine workes of all kind so they
take heed of too open seeming. Instead of song and
musick let them learn cookery and laundry, and instead
of reading Sir Philip Sidney’s ‘Arcadia,’ let them read
the grounds of good huswifery. I like not a female
poetesse at any hand: let greater personages glory their
skill in musicke, the posture of their bodies, their knowledge
in languages, the greatnesse and freedome of their
spirits, and their arts in arraigning of men’s affections at
their flattering faces: this is not the way to breede a
private gentleman’s daughter.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
The author of the above remarks suggests that
where there were several daughters, one should be
left with the mother, and the others drafted off into
some other household, such as that of a merchant,
or lawyer, or country gentleman, to gain experience
and multiply their matrimonial chances.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the custom of sending children
away to board in families was still common in
the seventeenth century, and that the domestic
ideal had not much enlarged. Women are still to
study housewifery before all else, and to shun learning
as an unprofitable thing. The profession of
marriage is the only one proper to women. “Loke
to thi doughten,” advises an early English <span class="locked">poet&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“And geve hem to spowsynge as soone as thei ben ablee.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In France the education of girls was much
neglected.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Il est honteux, mais ordinaire de voir des femmes qui
ont de l’esprit et de la politesse, ne savoir bien prononcer
ce qu’elles lisent; ou elles hesitent, ou elles chantent en
lisant: au lieu qu’il faut prononcer d’un ton simple et
naturel, mais forme et uni. Elles manquent encore plus
grossièrement pour l’ortogrape, ou pour la manière de
former ou de lier les lettres en écrivant.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Fénélon goes on to suggest that girls should
learn something of the laws and regulations of their
<span class="locked">country&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“ce que c’est qu’un contrat, une substitution, un partage
des cohéritiers ... ce que c’est biens meubles et immeubles.
Si elles se marient toutes leurs principales affaires
rouleront la-dessus.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In every age there is always some one to act
the part of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">laudator temporis acti</i>. Sir Matthew
Hale, the celebrated Lord Chief Justice, bemoans
the degeneracy of his own period. He <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In former times the education and employment of
young gentlewomen was religious, sober, and serious, their
carriage modest, and creditable was their habit and dress.
When they were young they learned to read and to sew;
as they grew up they learned to spin, to knit, to make
up their own garments; they learned what belonged to
housewifery.... And now the world is altered; young
gentlewomen learn to be bold, talk loud and more than
comes to their share, think it disparagement for them to
know what belongs to good housewifery or to practise it....
They know the ready way to consume an estate
and to ruin a family quickly, but neither know nor can
endure to learn or practise the ways and methods to save
it or increase it; and it is no wonder that great portions
are expected with them, for their portions are commonly
all their value.... If a fit of reading come upon them,
it is some romance, or play book, or love story; and if they
have at any time a fit of using their needle, it is some such
unprofitable or costly work that spends their friends or
husbands more than it is worth when it is finished.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Domestic life was changing, and the habits and
customs of former times were being modified. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
simple ways of old did not suffice. There were
too many distractions, at least in London, for
women to sit down contentedly with the resources
of their grandmothers. Among the well-to-do
country gentlemen it was becoming customary to
bring their families to London for the season, which
was then the winter, and this greatly altered the
tone of domestic life. To women confined to a
country village with little change of scene or occupation,
it meant as much as the “grand tour” in the
next century. A rebound naturally followed the
gloomy days of the Commonwealth, <span class="locked">when&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“there were no comedies or other diversions (which were
forbidden not only as ungodly but for fear of drawing
company or number together), and there was no business
for any man that loved monarchy or the family of Stuart;
so that the nobility and gentry lived most in the country.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Puritan movement retarded the intellectual
advance of women. The clearer thought which
the Renaissance brought was obscured, the ideals
that were beginning to enlarge the purpose of life
were narrowed, and a check was put upon mental
growth. As by the Roman Catholic Church women
were taught to submit their minds and consciences
to the priest, so under the sway of Puritanism they
were taught that all nature’s gifts to mind or body
were so many snares, that true life consisted in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
crushing out of all aims and desires not connected
with the saving of the soul, a process that was
apparently facilitated by a constant contemplation
of never-ending tortures supposed to be in reserve
for the greater portion of mankind.</p>

<p>With all its tyranny and its perverted teaching
on the subject of women’s position, the Roman
Church was a great civilizing, educating power,
the only one for centuries. Puritanism was the
reverse. It aimed at undoing what had been accomplished,
at checking progress. At a time when
the nation needed every stimulus that could be
applied to mental exertion, when political strife was
choking the path of culture, Puritanism stepped
in with a denunciation of learning and art as perils
to humanity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must be remembered
that Puritanism, with its uncompromising treatment
of vice, helped to raise the standard of social purity
and the ideal of womanhood. Like the fire which
followed the plague, Puritanism came as a great
cleansing force. But, like the fire, it destroyed
while it purified. Under its teaching many attained
to a high ideal of life. Every religion has its saints,
and the stress and suffering of the age were calculated
to bring out the qualities that go to the
making of heroes and martyrs. The Puritan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
maiden and the Puritan wife stand for some of the
noblest types of womanhood.</p>

<p>After the Restoration, the standard of living
went up, and luxury increased as the nation righted
itself after the turmoil and loss occasioned by war.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In 1688 there were on the ‘Change more men worth
£10,000 than there were in 1650 worth £1000; that £500
with a daughter was, in the latter period, deemed a larger
portion than £2000 in the former; that gentlewomen in
those earlier times thought themselves well clothed in
a serge gown which a chambermaid would, in 1688, be
ashamed to be seen in; and that besides the great increase
of rich clothes, plate, jewels, and household furniture,
coaches were in that time augmented a hundredfold.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In dealing with the position of women during
this period, it has to be taken into account that
what would be called society was stamped with the
manners of the court of Charles II. The court
party forgot its former troubles and revelled in
gaieties. The example was infectious, and the
general laxity and extravagance were so marked
that even the king himself referred to it in his
speech at the close of the Parliamentary Session of
1661&ndash;2.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I cannot but observe,” he said, “that the whole nation
seems to be a little corrupted in their excess of living;
sure all men spend much more in their clothes, in their
diet, and all other expences than they have been used to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
do; I hope it has been only the excess of joy after so long
suffering that has transported us to these other excesses,
but let us take heed that the continuance of them does not
indeed corrupt our natures. I do believe I have been
faulty myself; I promise you I will reform, and if you will
join with me in your several capacities, we shall by our
example do more good both in city and country than any
new laws would do.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was the reign of the senses. Beauty was the
road to greatness for women, and to beauty and wit
all other qualities yielded. The great ladies who
stand out most prominently on the canvas are the
royal favourites, the exquisite frail beauties who
dazzle the vision and eclipse the women of sterner
mould. Women forgot that they had any other
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> to play but one&mdash;that of syren. Those who
had no power to captivate dropped into the background,
were pushed aside, and forgotten. The
greatest lady was she who could sell herself at the
highest price, whose charms drew the largest
number of bidders. What she gloried in was the
rank and number of her lovers, and her ambition
was to flaunt her conquests in the eyes of other
women. Lady Castlemaine, Francis Stuart, Louise
de Querouaille, and Nell Gwynn of immortal
memory, together with many others whose task was
the subjugation of man, represent the society of the
Restoration period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
The disintegration of the times no doubt
militated against high ideals, although the Civil
War itself gave rise to the display of heroic virtues
on the part of both men and women. The stern
and awful discipline of the sword, far from degrading,
produced a nobler type of womanhood. Through
the trials entailed by ruined fortunes and blasted
careers, through the agonies of bereavement, women
passed triumphant, but they were not proof against
the war of social forces. The conflict of feeling
between the opposing parties on other than State
questions sent both to extremes. The Royalists, in
their hearty hatred of austerity, rushed into a wild
worship of the senses. The Puritans, to express
their horror of the worldliness of their foes, assumed
virtues they did not possess. It has been averred
that if we study the characters and lives of the
great ladies of the Puritan party, we shall find much
laxity under the guise of strictness. It would not
be matter of surprise if, in some cases, this were so,
though the bulk of the party seem free from such
a reproach. The general tone of society was
lowered from various causes. It is seen in everything,
in the literature, on the stage, in the habits
of the day. The coarse tastes of the upper classes
show that the standard of public propriety was not
at all commensurate with the degree of enlightenment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
which that age enjoyed. Wanting higher intellectual
interests, women in fashionable life filled up
their time with cards and dice, and if they read
anything they read romances of very poor quality.
This condition of things continued through the
century.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Were the men,” wrote Mary Astell in 1694, “as much
neglected and as little care taken to cultivate and improve
them, perhaps they would be so far from surpassing those
whom they now despise, that they themselves would sink
into the greatest stupidity and brutality. The preposterous
returns that the most of them make to all the care that is
bestow’d on them renders this no uncharitable nor improbable
conjecture.”</p></blockquote>

<p>John Evelyn speaks of great ladies suffering
themselves to be treated in <span class="locked">taverns&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“where a courtesan in other cities would scarcely vouchsafe
to be entertain’d; but you will be more astonish’d when
I shall assure you that they drink their crowned cups
roundly, strain healths through their smocks, daunce after
the fiddle, kiss freely and team it an honourable treat.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And this, he goes on to say, was not confined to the
lower or the more “meretricious” circles, but was a
common spectacle in good houses where such sports
were the afternoon diversion.</p>

<p>The following letter from that lively young lady
of fashion, Bridget Noel, to her sister, the Countess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
of Rutland, in April, 1687, shows what sort of
diversions occupied the aristocracy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I am extreme sory it is not poseble for us to wat of
my deare sister suner than the 28 of May, for hear is a
coking and hors matches which we have promesed to be
at. My Lord Toumand will be at the great coking, and
Barney and Lord Grandson and a great many more lords
that I doe not know ther name, it is sade hear that it will
be as great a match as ever has been. Barney intends to
back our coks with thousands, for he is of our side....
The great coking dos not begin tell the 29 and twenty of
June, but we have a letel wan begins of Whesen Monday.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1663, among the rules laid down for the
behaviour of men who wish to be considered well-bred,
occurs the following <span class="locked">recommendation&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is not becoming a person of quality when in the
company of ladies to handle them roughly ... to kiss
them by surprize; to pull off their hoods; to snatch away
their handkerchiefs; to rob them of their ribbands and
put them in his hat; to force their letters or books from
them; to look into their papers, etc. You must be very
familiar to use them at that rate; and unless you be so
nothing can be more indecent or render you more odious.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Such admonitions now would be considered an
impertinence if addressed to a club of factory
hands.</p>

<p>We must give the seventeenth century credit
for introducing some refinements which undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
had an influence on the position of women. Social
customs are useful indices to national character, and
daily habits often give the key to the moral
standard. As long as coarse feeding and heavy
drinking prevailed, there was a barrier to social
intercourse between the sexes. When the ale and
wine, which had been habitually drunk at every
meal, were replaced by coffee and tea, it was an
undoubted gain to both health and manners. The
taste became more refined, repasts ceased to be
orgies unfit for the presence of women. John
Evelyn considered the custom of gentlemen leaving
ladies to themselves after dinner, or rather of the
ladies quitting the gentlemen, as barbarous, and it
certainly had its origin in barbarous manners. He
would doubtless have been astonished if he could
have foreseen that the custom continued in force
for more than two hundred years after his time,
when regular drinking-bouts had ceased.</p>

<p>Evelyn’s complaint of the indelicacy of ladies
speaking of gentlemen by their Christian names is
a little hypercritical. It was the manners that
needed alteration more than the speech. He is
shocked to hear such talk <span class="locked">as&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Tom P. was here to-day. I went yesterday to the
Cours with Will R., and Harry M. treated me at such
a tavern.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Surely what Evelyn calls, with a fine scorn, this
“particular idiom” and these “gracefull confidences”
were not inconsistent with the character of ladies
who consented to be treated at taverns. De
Cominges, ambassador from France in the reign
of Charles II., observes <span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“excesses in taverns and brothels pass among people of
note merely for gallantries, and even women of good
condition do not refuse a gallant to accompany him to
drink Spanish wine.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It hardly becomes a Frenchman to comment on
the coarseness of the English, considering the
licentiousness among his own people. In France
marriage was a constant subject of satire,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> and
much of the profligacy of our court and society was
due to French influence. The French nobility
hated the bourgeoisie, and could not forgive them
for their higher moral tone.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>The Puritans, in their war against vice, endeavoured
to lay waste the fields of culture and
learning. Everything which ministered to the
pleasure of the senses they treated as a snare to
be avoided. The remedy which they applied to
the ills of society was in itself a disease. George
Fox, declaiming against the schoolmistresses who
teach young women “to play of instruments and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
music of all kinds,” shows the attitude of the
Puritan party in the matter of ordinary education.
A catch, a song, or a dance, Fox looked upon as
destructive of modesty, things leading to wantonness,
and only fitted “for them that live in the lusts
of the world.” It was little wonder that, with
learning at a discount and accomplishments denounced
as sinful, women became frivolous and
narrow. The light-hearted, in rebellion against the
austerities of their Puritan neighbours, plunged into
excesses, and the more serious subsided into a
round of domestic drudgery.</p>

<p>To men of the old order the times seemed sadly
out of joint.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“All relations were confounded by the <em>several sects
in religion</em> which discountenanced all forms of reverence
and respect as reliques and marks of superstition.
Children asked not blessing of their parents; nor did
they concern themselves in the education of their children,
but were well content that they should take any
course to maintain themselves that they might be free
from that expense. The young women conversed without
any circumspection or modesty, and frequently met at
taverns and common eating houses; and they who were
stricter and more severe in their comportment became
the wives of the seditious preachers or of officers of the
army. The daughters of noble and illustrious families
bestowed themselves upon the <em>divines of the time</em> or other
low and unequal matches. Parents had no manner of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
authority over their children, nor children any obedience
or submission to their parents; but every one did that
which was good in his own eyes.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The loss of property occasioned by the Civil
War caused great domestic upheavals. Many a
family was brought to the brink of ruin. It was
then that the women bestirred themselves. The
daughters of men whose estates had been confiscated,
the wives who had brought their husbands dowers,
finding themselves denuded, made strenuous efforts
to recover their possessions, in the absence through
death or enforced exile of their male protectors.
The Duchess of Newcastle, who was herself a
sufferer,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> looked with grave disapprobation upon the
more energetic of her sex at this juncture. She
complains <span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“women become pleaders, attornies, petitioners and the
like, running about with their several causes, complaining
of their several grievances, exclaiming against their
several enemies, bragging of their several favours they
receive from the powerful; thus trafficing with idle words,
bringing in false reports and vain discourse.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There were, of course, pretenders among the
numerous claimants, people who, as the duchess
avers, “made it their trade to solicit.”</p>

<p>As a rule, however, women in everyday life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
were secluded from the bustle of public affairs.
According to Walpole, after the Restoration, the
really respectable, well-conducted members of the
female sex were neither seen nor heard outside
their own home circle. That they led very dull
lives seems pretty obvious, for they had neither the
resources of learning and culture nor the distractions
of society. But they enjoyed more personal freedom
than women on the Continent. The Prince of
Tuscany, who visited England, observes of the
<span class="locked">women&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“They live with all the liberty that the custom of the
country authorizes. This custom dispenses with that
rigorous constraint and reservedness which are practised
by the women of other countries, and they go whithersoever
they please, either alone or in company.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Gentlewomen of good position were accustomed,
in the seventeenth century, to live in a simple way,
within the four walls of their home, occupied with
domestic affairs. The wife of Sir John Coke, who
was Secretary of State in the reign of Charles I.,
when she writes to her husband from the country,
discourses to him of the children and of the needlework
she is doing for the baby in homely fashion,
and thanks him for sending her a new gown and
hat, as if she were unused to fine clothes. Lady
Anne Halkett, who played a notable part in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
political troubles of her day, lived a quiet life
enough when public affairs did not demand her
attention, and spent her time like any good housewife.
She was fond of gathering herbs and compounding
powders and conserves for the sick poor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“She was ever imployed either in doing or reaping
good: in the summer season she vyed with the bee or ant,
in gathering herbs, flowers, worms, snails, etc., for the still
or limbeck, for the mortar or boyling pan, etc., and was
ordinarily then in a dress fitted for her still-house; making
preparations of extracted waters, spirits, ointments, conserves,
salves, powders, etc., which she ministred every
Wednesday to a multitude of poor infirm persons, besides
what she dayly sent abroad to persons of all ranks who
consulted her in their maladies.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mary Astell, however, who was so anxious
about the intellectual advancement of her sex,

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“keep the books, balance the accounts, and do all the

<p>Englishwomen could certainly not have coped
with accounts if their arithmetic were on a par with
their spelling. But they appear to have had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
complete control over domestic matters, or at least
to have impressed foreigners with that belief.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“So great,” wrote one visitor, “is the respect which the

<p>In the opinion of a contemporary English

<p>“There is also the want of halfe a man’s liberty in

believe when they are going to Church upon their wedding

part I am not married; if I were I should finde my wings
clipt and the collar too streight for my neck.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">While</span> the war was proceeding between Charles I.
and the Parliament, there was a good deal of agitation
among the City dames, who, though not obliged
to stand siege and battery, were deeply interested
in the issues of the struggle. As members of the
commercial classes, the disastrous effects of a civil
war appealed to them with peculiar force. They
lamented the destruction of property as well as the
loss of life, the stoppage of trade, and the general
dislocation of society. And as women of great
earnestness in religion, they conceived a horror of
this slaughter among men of the same nation&mdash;indeed,
of the same kindred. At length they could
bear it no longer. They resolved to put forth some
protest. In the year 1643 came their opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
The City of London had just been petitioning
the Commons against the propositions for peace
which had been under consideration in the House
of Lords. Their lordships were very anxious to
stop the desolation caused by the war, and framed
some propositions to the king, which they ordered
that the Speaker should introduce to the Commons.
There was a very hot debate on these propositions,
and the aldermen and common council, greatly
incensed at the idea of any accommodation which
they feared would be destructive, as they expressed
it, of their “religion, laws, and liberties,” promised
help for the continuance of hostilities if the Parliament
would stand firm and reject all overtures.
The House of Commons were so worked upon by
this petition, that they returned their hearty thanks
to the City and stopped all further negotiations.
Thereupon the London citizenesses bestirred themselves,
and, with white silk ribbons in their hats, repaired
in great numbers to the House of Commons
with a counter petition in favour of peace. The
petition is described as that of “many civilly disposed
women inhabiting the cities of London, Westminster,
and the parts adjacent.” It ran <span class="locked">thus&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“That your petitioners, though of the weaker sex, do
too sensibly perceive the ensuing desolation of this kingdom
unless by some timely means your honours provide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
for the speedy recovery thereof. Your honours are the
physicians that can by God’s special and miraculous blessing
(which we humbly implore) restore this languishing
nation, and our bleeding sister the kingdom of Ireland,
which hath now almost breathed her last gasp. We need
not dictate to your eagle eyed judgments the way; our
only desire is that God’s glory in the true Reformed
Protestant Religion may be preserved; the just prerogatives
and privileges of king and parliament maintained;
the true liberties and properties of the subject, according
to the known laws of the land, restored; and all honourable
ways and means for a speedy peace endeavoured.
May it therefore please your honours that some speedy
course may be taken for the settlement of the true Reformed
Protestant Religion for the glory of God and the
renovation of trade for the benefit of the subject, they
being the soul and body of the kingdom. And your
petitioners with many millions of afflicted souls, groaning
under the burden of these times of distresses, shall (as
bound) pray, etc.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Rushworth, in his “Historical Collections,” gives
a graphic account of the presentation of this petition.
He says it was brought up by “two or three
thousand women, but generally of the meanest
sort;” that the House sent out a deputation of
three or four members with the answer that they
<span class="locked">were&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“no ways enemies to peace, and that they did not doubt
in a short time to answer the ends of their petition, and
desired them to return to their habitations. But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
women, not satisfied, remain’d thereabouts; and by noon
were encreased to 5000 at the least; and some men of
the rabble in womens cloaths mixt themselves amongst
them, and instigated them to go on to the Commons door
and cry ‘Peace, Peace,’ which they did accordingly, thrusting
to the door of the House at the upper stairs head;
and as soon as they were pass’d, a part of the Trained
Band (that usually stood sentinel there) thrust the soldiers
down and would suffer none to come in or go out of the
House for near two hours. The Trained Band advised
them to come down, and first pulled them; and afterwards
to fright them shot powder. But they cry’d out, nothing
but powder; and having brickbats in the yard, threw them
apace at the Trained Band, who then shot bullets, and
killed a ballad singer with one arm, that was heartning
on the women, and another poor man that came accidentally.
Yet the women not daunted, cry’d out the louder
at the door of the House of Commons, ‘Give us these
traitors that are against peace that we may tear them to
pieces, give us that dog Pym.’ At last ten of Waller’s
troopers (some of them cornets) having his colours in
their hats, came to pass by the women, who would needs
have the soldiers colours out of their hats, and took away
the ribbons from two of them, and call’d them Waller’s
dogs. Whereupon they drew their swords, and laid on
some of them flatways, but seeing that would not keep
them off at last cut them over the hands and faces, and
one woman lost her nose; whereof ’twas reported, she
afterwards died. As soon as the rest of the women saw
blood drawn they ran away from the Parliament House,
and scatter’d themselves in the Church-yard, the palace
yard, and places adjacent. And about an hour after the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
House was up, a troop of horse came and cudgell’d such
as staid with their canes and dispersed them. But unhappily,
a maid-servant that had nothing to do in the
tumult, was shot as she pass’d over the church-yard. The
trooper that did it was sent to the Gate House, in order to
his trial for her death; but he alledged his pistol went off
by mischance. Serjeant Francis and one Mr. Pulsford
were committed for encouraging this Female Riot.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When the “Saints” plundered the Royalists
of their possessions, the women of the despoiled
families went in person to the Committee of
Sequestration sitting in Goldsmiths’ Hall, to try
and recover some of their property. Mothers
leading their children, some of them widows,
thronged the hall daily.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“The gentry are sequestered all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our wives you find at Goldsmiths’ Hall,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the first year of the Protectorate there was
a petition presented to the Commons by tradesmen’s
wives, praying for a redress of grievances. They
assembled in great crowds before the doors of the
House, and the commander of the guard, Serjeant-Major
Skippon, aghast at the increasing numbers,
asked the House what he was to do, for the women
had told <span class="locked">him&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p class="in0">“that where there was one now there would be five
hundred the next day, and that it was as good for them
to die here as at home.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The major was told to use fair words and persuade
them to go away, but down they came, as they had
threatened, the next day, with a petition described
as that of <span class="locked">the&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“Gentlewomen, Tradesmen’s wives, and many others of
the female sex, all inhabitants of the City of London and
the Suburbs thereof.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The phraseology of the petition, as well as the
substance, shows the Puritan character of the
petitioners.</p>

<p>The grievances which these tradesmen’s wives
were so earnest to get removed had nothing to do
with duties levied on merchandize, or any other
of the hardships of which traders were wont to
complain, such as the importation of foreign goods
and the presence of foreign artisans and merchants.
This petition was inspired by dread of the Papists,
lest they should commit in England the “insolencies,
savage usage, and unheard of rapes” which they
had been committing upon women in Ireland.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“And have we not just cause to fear,” urged the petitioners,
“that they will prove the forerunners of our ruin,
except Almighty God, by the wisdom and care of this
Parliament, be pleased to succour us, our husbands and
children, which are as dear and tender to us as the lives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
and blood of our hearts; to see them murdered and
mangled and cut in pieces before our eyes; to see our
children dashed against the stones, and the mothers’ milk
mingled with the infants’ blood, running down the streets;
to see our houses on flaming fire over our heads....
Thousands of our friends have been compelled to fly from
episcopal persecutions into desert places among wild
beasts.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After further denunciations of the Papists, the
petitioners <span class="locked">proceed&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The remembrance of all these fearful accidents do
strongly move us, from the example of the Women of
Tekoah, to fall submissively at the feet of his Majesty
our dread Sovereign, and cry, ‘Help, O King! Help ye
the noble worthies now sitting in Parliament.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems unnecessary to apologize for presenting
such a memorial, but the petitioners thought otherwise,
and gave as one of their reasons that “women
are sharers in the calamities that accompany both
Church and Commonwealth.”</p>

<p>The petition was presented by Mrs. Anne
Stagg, a brewer’s wife, in company with others of
similar rank.</p>

<p>Pym was chosen as spokesman by the Commons,
and, going to the door of the House, addressed the
<span class="locked">petitioners&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Good women, your Petition with the reasons hath
been read in the House and is thankfully accepted of, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
is come in a seasonable time. You will, God willing,
receive from us all the satisfaction which we can possibly
give to your just and lawful desires. We intreat you,
therefore, to repair to your houses and turn your petition
which you have delivered here into prayers at home for
us, for we have been and are and shall be, to our utmost
power, ready to relieve you, your husbands and children,
and to perform the trust committed unto us, towards God,
our king and country, as becometh faithful Christian and
loyal subjects.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Although there was no longer a king upon the
throne, Pym speaks as if he still had a sovereign
to whom he owed obedience.</p>

<p>A few years later, in October, 1651, the women
are petitioning the government again, but with a
very different object. It is a memorial to Cromwell
against imprisonment for debt, a grievance not to
be remedied for many a year. The petition sets
<span class="locked">forth&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“That the Norman yoke of bondage and oppression is
still continued upon this nation by the impious, oppressive,
delatory, and most chargeable practice of the law, and
destructive imprisonment of men and women for debt in
the several prisons, goals, counters, holes, and dungeons
of cruelty in this land.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The petitioners complain that the Act for the
relief of poor debtors is no benefit, <span class="locked">and&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p class="in0">“that the present intricate, delatory, chargeable, oppressive,
endless practise of the Law, is become an abettor, encouragement
and prop to all oppressors and defrauders,
and an Egyptian reed and discouragement to most men,
but in especial to all the poor who thereby are utterly
disabled and disheartened from suing for their debts,
rights, and inheritances, violently held from them by the
rich and mighty. And if at any time (by the law) their
debts and rights are seemingly recovered, yet then their
able debtors have freedom (by the law and strength of
their purses) to vacate judgements to arrest and imprison
poor creditors upon false and strained actions (for many
years) thereby enforcing some of them to compound with
them at their own rates; others of them to perish
miserably in goals, and so to lose both their debts and
lives; whereby their wives and children are exposed to
unexpressible misery; besides the many other unexpressible
oppressions daylie practised by the rich and mighty
on poor and simple hearted men and women in this land
by sons of Belial.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Cromwell is exhorted to act as “a faithful
Joshua with the zeal of Nehemiah,” and the petition
<span class="locked">proceeds&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The premisses piously considered, and for that the
other weighty affairs of this land will not permit the
speedy accomplishment of these particulars (by your
Excellency) as your petitioners humbly conceive, in
gaining a new representative; from which lawyers, and
all ill-affected persons to be excluded. Your petitioners
therefore humbly pray that in the meantime there may be
such a course established as that the poor may by some
easie and speedy way reap the fruit of justice.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
It has been said that “women have not
suffycent understanding for to lerne the lawes;”
but, as the old writer who commented on this
statement observed, “the contrary is made open
by experyence.” Certainly the Puritan dames
of the seventeenth century had “suffycent understanding”
to realize the defects and hardships of
the laws.</p>

<p>The fearful suffering caused to the inhabitants
of the western counties after Monmouth’s rebellion
by that incarnation of cruelty, Judge Jeffreys,
brought forth a women’s petition of another kind.
It is styled “The Humble Petition of the Widows
and Fatherless Children in the West of England,”
and <span class="locked">begins&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We to the number of a thousand and more, widows
and fatherless children, of the counties of Dorset, Somerset
and Devon, our dear husbands and tender fathers having
been so tyrannously butcher’d and some transported, our
estates sold from us, and our inheritance cut off by the
severe and harsh sentence of George Lord Jeffreys, now
we understand in the Tower of London a prisoner, who
has lately, we hear, endeavoured to excuse himself from
those tyrannical and illegal sentences by laying it on
information by some gentlemen who are known to us
to be good Christians, true Protestants and Englishmen.
We your poor petitioners, many hundreds of us, on our
knees have begg’d mercy for our dear husbands and
tender parents, from his cruel hands, but his thirst for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
blood was so great and his barbarism so cruel that instead
of granting mercy to some which were made to appear
innocent and petitioned for by the flower of the gentry
of the said counties, he immediately caus’d them to be
executed.... These with many hundred more tyrannical
acts are ready to be made appear in the said counties by
honest and credible persons; and therefore your Petitioners
desire that the said Lord Jeffreys, late Lord Chancellor,
the vilest of men, may be brought down to the Counties
aforesaid, where we the good women in the West, shall
be glad to see him; and give him another manner of
welcome than he had there years since.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Hannah Hewling, who married Major Henry
Cromwell, grandson of Oliver Cromwell, played a
notable part during the terrible period following
the Monmouth Rebellion. Both her brothers,
Benjamin and William, were implicated and condemned
to death. Hannah, who was at that time
a young, unmarried girl, waylaid Judge Jeffreys
in his coach, beseeching him to stay the sentence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The merciless judge, to make her let go, caus’d the
coachman to cut her hands and fingers with the lash of
his whip. Nor would he allow the respite of the execution
but for two days, tho’ the sister, with tears in her eyes,
offered a hundred pounds for so small a favour.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Hannah also vainly interceded with the king,
James II. Lord Churchill, by whom she was
introduced, warned her of the king’s obstinacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Madam,” said he, “hearty as my wishes are that
you may obtain what you want, I dare not flatter you
with any such hope, for that marble (laying his hand on
the chimneypiece at which he was standing) is as capable
of feeling compassion as the King’s heart.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After her marriage Hannah exercised a great
deal of influence in the Cromwell family. She
was of a strong Evangelical cast of mind and
a Dissenter. Through her the Dowager Lady
Cromwell was induced to substitute a Baptist
minister for the Anglican clergyman she had been
accustomed to have about her as chaplain.</p>

<p>Divers have been the parts which women of
the middle classes have played in politics in days
gone by. Even when it was a part involving a
good deal of publicity they did not shrink, and
their practical common sense was unclouded by
any sentimental haze of doubt as to their “proper
sphere.” Everything that concerned their families
or the commonweal they felt to be within their
sphere, and they did not conceive the idea that
politics were the concern of one sex alone. That
complex creation of to-day, the “New Woman,” to
whom is ascribed, among other things, an unfeminine
taste for politics, is not so modern after all.
History is repeating itself, and the progenitors of
the political woman are to be found far back in the
days of the Lancastrians.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">The</span> great constitutional struggle of the seventeenth
century was a struggle in which the whole nation
was engaged. Every move on either side sent
a thrill of hope or fear, of joy or indignation,
throughout the kingdom. The brave defence of
castle and home by the women, the patient endurance
of hardship, the courage in presence of
danger, the quick wit which could avert misfortune,
make the Civil War of the seventeenth century
peculiarly rich in striking incident. Every family
of importance was ranged on one side or the other,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
and many a one that could lay claim to no special
distinction acquired fame during the struggle, while
a fierce additional interest was lent by the religious
element. All classes, in fact, were affected. None
could stand aloof. The civil war became not only
a national but also a domestic question, a matter of
the deepest personal concern to hundreds who had
no interest in statecraft. It was remarkable for
the absence of any foreign element. The contest
lay between King and people, or rather between
royal prerogative and the liberty of the subject.
The Queen herself, Henrietta of Nance, though as
a Roman Catholic she was the source of contention,
played but an insignificant part in the war. She
had not the spirit of Margaret of Anjou, and, on
account of her alien creed, commanded the sympathies
of neither side. The Queen never formed
a party strong enough to change the current of
events. She was one of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> in
the great tragedy, but not a leading actor. It was
a people’s war. The influence of foreign allies, the
factions of court favourites, were as nothing. In
former periods when civil war had raged, the flame
had been kindled and fed by disputes for power
among sovereigns and princes; the struggle had
always assumed something of an imperial character.
In the seventeenth century it was a purely internal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
dissension. Hence the overwhelming interest felt
in the struggle by both women as well as men, of
all classes.</p>

<p>Women both on the Royalist and the Puritan
side were in the thick of the fray, sometimes
actually taking part in the fight, as in the case of
the Countess of Derby, whose defence of Lathom
House against the Parliamentarians is among the
most noted incidents of the war; or like Lucy
Hutchinson, playing an equally important <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> in
attending to the wounded. Mrs. Hutchinson, strong
Puritan as she was, regarded Cromwell as a usurper
and a despot, though she admitted his greatness,
and his family excited her scorn and derision.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“His wife and children were setting up for principality
which suited no better with any of them than scarlet on
the ape; only to speak the truth of himself, he had much
natural greatness and well became the place he had usurped.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Lucy Hutchinson’s father, Sir Allen Aspley,
was governor of the Tower during the time of Sir
Walter Raleigh’s imprisonment. Her mother was
in the habit of visiting Sir Walter, and helping him
with the chemical experiments with which he wiled
away the hours when not engaged in writing his
“History of the World.” It has been suggested
that Mrs. Hutchinson obtained from her mother
some knowledge of the properties of medicine, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
during the siege of Nottingham she proved most
helpful in dressing the soldiers’ wounds, and her
plasters and balsams were found most efficacious
even in dangerous cases. Mrs. Hutchinson was
not the only member of her sex who proved
herself able and ready for action in the city of
Nottingham. After the siege was practically over,
and the royalist forces had departed, the town
was constantly being fired. Thereupon the women
banded themselves together, and in parties of fifty
patrolled the streets every night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hutchinson was of great service, at the
beginning of 1660, in assisting to quell the disturbances
which arose over the elections. There was
a strong party in the city for the King, and much
ill feeling aroused between the townsmen and the
soldiers of the Commonwealth. Just as matters
were coming to a crisis and the soldiers were
preparing to take vengeance on the citizens, Mrs.
Hutchinson opportunely <span class="locked">arrived&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“and being acquainted with the captaines perswaded them
to doe nothing in a tumultuary way, however provok’d, but
to complain to the generall, and lett him decide the
businesse. The men, att her entreaty, were content so to
doe, the townsmen alsoe consenting to restreine their
children and servants and keepe the publick peace.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was in the year 1643 that the Countess of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Derby began her memorable defence of Lathom
House. The Countess was a Frenchwoman, a
daughter of the Duc de Tremouille, and a descendant
of Count William of Nassau. Negotiations
began in May with a summons from Mr. Holland,
Governor of Manchester, to Lady Derby to subscribe
to the propositions of the Parliament or yield
up Lathom House. The Earl was then away,
fighting for the King. Her ladyship refused either
to subscribe or to give up her house.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“From this time she endured a continual siege, being,
with the exception of the gardens and walks, confined as
a prisoner within her own walls, with the liberty of the
castle-yard, suffering the sequestration of the whole estate,
besides daily affronts and indignities from unworthy
persons.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Countess was very circumspect, putting
a restraint upon her soldiers, and giving no provocation
to her foes, “and so by her wisdom kept them
at a more favourable distance for the space of almost
a whole year.”</p>

<p>In the following February Sir Thomas Fairfax
wrote demanding surrender, to which the Countess
replied <span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“she much wondered that Sir Thomas Fairfax should
require her to give up her lord’s house without any offence
on her part done to the Parliament, desiring that in a
business of such weight which struck both at her religion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
and at her life, and that so nearly concerned her sovereign,
her lord, and her whole posterity, she might have a week’s
consideration.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Parliamentarian general then proposed a
conference at a house about a quarter of a mile
distant from Lathom House, but the Countess
refused with dignity, saying she conceived it “more
knightly that Sir Thomas Fairfax should wait upon
her than she upon him.” After further parleyings
with Parliamentarians, she finally sent the following
spirited <span class="locked">message:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“That she refused all their articles, and was truly
happy that they had refused hers, protesting she had
rather hazard her life than offer the like again. That
though a woman and a stranger, divorced from her friends
and robbed of her estate, she was ready to receive their
utmost violence, trusting in God both for protection and
deliverance.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The siege thereupon commenced, and was
carried on in a desultory fashion by Sir Thomas
Fairfax, who, after six or seven weeks, resigned his
post to Colonel Rigby of Preston. The Countess
commanded her troops, numbering three hundred
soldiers, in person. The besiegers amounted to
between two and three thousand men, of whom
they lost five hundred, while the Countess lost only
six during the whole period, two of those being
killed by their own negligence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
After manufacturing a number of grenadoes, the
Colonel sent a very peremptory message to the
Countess demanding that Lathom House should be
surrendered. Lady Derby received the message
surrounded by her troops. She tore up the paper,
and, turning to the messenger, <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Tell that insolent rebel [Rigby] he shall neither
have person, goods, nor house; when our strength of
provisions are spent, we shall find a fire more merciful than
Rigby’s, and then, if the providence of God prevent it not,
my goods and house shall burn in his sight; and myself,
children, and soldiers, rather than fall into his hands, will
seal our religion and loyalty in the same flame.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Countess followed up her words with deeds,
and at four o’clock the next morning caused a sally
to be made, whereby her soldiers got possession of
the ditch and rampart, and of a very destructive
mortar piece which had been pouring forth
grenadoes from its mouth on to the besieged.
Rigby wrote to the deputy-lieutenants of Lancashire
begging for assistance. “The length of the siege,”
he complained, “and the hard duties have wearied
all soldiers.” As for himself, he says, “I almost
languish under the burden, having toiled above
my strength.” However, nobody had time to
attend to Rigby’s complaints, and after a few more
weeks he raised the siege. Help was now coming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
to the beleaguered garrison. The Earl of Derby
and Prince Rupert were on their way, and Rigby,
in his endeavours to escape the Royalist forces, was
surprised and badly beaten just as he had reached
the town of Bolton.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In this memorable action the Countess was amply
revenged. The Earl of Derby took the first colour that
fell before the Royalists, and with his own hand cut down
a man who had once been his servant, but who had
deserted with the intention of betraying his mistress in the
time of her greatest peril.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Another memorable siege in 1643 was that of
Wardour Castle in Wiltshire, the family seat of
Lord Arundel. The Parliamentarians seized the
opportunity when Lord Arundel was engaged in
the king’s service at Oxford to besiege the castle.
They came with a supposed warrant to seize certain
plate, money, and arms. Lady Blanche Arundel,
though she had only a handful of men&mdash;twenty-five,
it is said&mdash;to oppose the thirteen hundred soldiers
mustered under Sir Edward Hungerford and
Colonel Strode, bravely refused to yield to the
demand that she should surrender the castle, saying
“she had a command from her lord to keep it, and
she would obey his command.” Cannon were
brought up within musket-shot, and the battery
continued from Wednesday to the following Monday.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Two mines were sprung in a vault through which
food was conveyed. One of these mines, being
connected by passages with several parts of the
castle, did much damage.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Hungerford again and again offered
to grant quarter to the women and children if the
castle were surrendered, but the offer was contemptuously
refused, the women bravely resolving
to die beside the men rather than live on dishonourable
terms. The female servants were very useful
in reloading muskets and bringing food to the
soldiers.</p>

<p>But at length the besieged became worn out with
the strain. Food was short, and they got no rest
night or day. The soldiers were so faint and
weary they could scarcely wield their arms.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It might have been a doubt which they would have
first loaded their muskets withal, either powder before
bullet or bullet before powder, had not the maid servants
(valiant beyond their sex) assisted them and done that
service for them. Lastly, now when the rebels had
brought petarrs and applied them to the garden door
(which if forced opened a free passage into the castle), and
balls of wild fire to show in at their windows, and all hope
of keeping the castle was taken away; now, and not till
now, did the besieged sound a parley.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This was after the siege had lasted nine days.
Five van-loads of costly furniture were carried off by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
the Parliamentarians, who plundered and destroyed
as much as £100,000 worth of property. The
women and children were carried off prisoners to
Shaftesbury.</p>

<p>Corfe Castle, Dorsetshire, was bravely held
for the Royalists in 1643 by Lady Mary Bankes,
wife of the Lord Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas, “to her eternall honour be it spoken, with
her daughters, women and five soldiers.” Being
so short of men and arms, the besieged had recourse
to stones and hot embers. These missiles they
cast over the walls, which the foe were attempting
to scale, and greatly diminished the strength of the
attack. The siege lasted six weeks, and the leader
of the Parliamentarian army was so dispirited that
when the news arrived that a party of Royalists
were advancing to relieve the castle, he took flight.
The next in command, not being disposed to try
conclusions with a fresh force, did not even wait to
collect his artillery and ammunition, but slipped
away at night in a boat. Among other booty he
left behind about a hundred horses.</p>

<p>A distinguished Irish lady, Lettice Digby,
Baroness of Offaley, displayed marvellous courage
during the troubles of 1641, when the Irish rebels
stormed her castle of Greashill, in King’s County.
Although she was upwards of sixty years of age,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
she undertook the defence of her home with great
vigour. The castle stood in the midst of bogs and
woods, and Lady Lettice, relying on the security of
her position, closed the gates and refused to listen
to any terms for surrender. She was at length
relieved by Viscount Lisle and Sir Charles Cook,
and, having been supplied with food and firearms,
she resolved not to leave the castle, but to take the
risk of another assault. This occurred soon after,
and on this second occasion Sir Richard Grenville
came to her aid. Apparently this valorous lady
was then induced to change her quarters. She
died in 1658, at Cobs Hill, Warwickshire, one of
her estates.</p>

<p>Lady Fanshawe, whose father was an ardent
Royalist, endured a good deal both before and after
her marriage, which took place in 1644. Sir Richard
Fanshawe, who was a connection on her mother’s
side, held the post of Secretary of War to the
Prince of Wales, and was taken prisoner at the
battle of Worcester.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“During the time of his imprisonment,” writes Lady
Fanshawe in the “Memoirs” she compiled for her
children, “I failed not constantly to go when the clock
struck four in the morning, with a dark lantern in my hand,
all alone and on foot, from my lodgings in Chancery-lane,
at my cousin Youngs, to Whitehall, in at the entry that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
went out of King-street into the Bowling-green. There I
would go under his window and softly call him; he, after
the first time excepted, never failed to put out his head at
the first call: thus we talked together, and sometimes
I was so wet with the rain that it went in at my neck and
out at my heels. He directed me how I should make my
addresses, which I did ever to their General Cromwell, who
had a great respect for your father, and would have bought
him off to his service upon any terms.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After great exertions, she succeeded in getting
her husband released on bail.</p>

<p>While in Ireland Lady Fanshawe displayed
great courage. She was in Cork with her children,
her husband being engaged elsewhere, during the
revolt of 1649. The city was in the hands of
Cromwell’s army, but “through thousands of naked
swords” she conveyed her children and her maids
to a place of safety.</p>

<p>During the war women as well as men were
called upon to contribute money and arms to the
Commonwealth. A letter from Cromwell himself
was addressed from Huntingdon, August 2, 1643,
“to the Bachelors and Maids.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I understand,” he wrote, “by these gentlemen, the
good affection of your young men and maids, for which
God is to be praised. I approve of the business, only I
desire to advise you that your foot company may be
turned into a troop of horse, which indeed will (by God’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
blessing) far more advantage the cause than two or three
companies of foot, especially if your men be honest, godly
men, which by all means I desire. I thank God for stirring
up the youth to cast in their mite, which I desire may
be employed to the best advantage; therefore my advice
is, that you would employ your twelve-score pounds to
buy my pistols and saddles, and I will provide four-score
horses; for £400 more will not raise a troop of horse.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A typical instance of the straits to which gentlewomen
were reduced, and the hardships and injuries
which they suffered, may be found in the case
of Mistress Joyce Jefferies, a maiden lady of good
birth and some fortune, living on her own property
in the thoroughly Royalist city of Hereford, which
went through many vicissitudes during the Civil
War. In 1638 Mistress Jefferies was called upon
for ship money. This she paid, and also provided
one soldier in respect of her farm and one for her
other property in Hereford when the Trained
Bands were called out. The ancestral armour
which hung rusting on her walls she had taken
down and cleaned ready for use. Up to the year
1642 Mistress Jefferies was able to remain unmolested
in her own house, but in September of
that year the Earl of Essex was advancing rapidly
westward and took possession of the city of Worcester.
It was felt that Hereford was no longer
a safe place for Royalists, so, packing up some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
furniture and clothes, Mistress Jefferies got into her
carriage and drove away.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I came,” she writes in her diary or account-book,
“to Kilkinton, to my cosin penreeses house from heriford
for feare of ye parliaments army, September 23<sup>d</sup>, 1642.
The 27 I came from thence to Mr. Geeres at Garnons.”</p></blockquote>

<p>She contrived to have some of her possessions
sent after her, for there are records of payment to
different <span class="locked">carriers&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Paid Edward Parsons of heryford for helpping to
carry my goods out of my howse in heriford to the cart
that brought hit to Kilkinton, for feare of ye coming of
ye parliaments army from Worcester to heriford 1<sup>s</sup>. Gave
another man for helpping in the same work 3<sup>d</sup>. Paid
Edward Stefens, Carier, for cariing a way my trunks and
boxes and bedding from heriford to Kilkinton 25<sup>s</sup>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>She saved some things by hiding them in the
coal cellar, for she notes down that she paid fourpence
to a “carpinder to pass my standard powles
in ye cole house when the souldiers would had
them barricade Widmarsh Gate.” She did not
get away much too soon, for she <span class="locked">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Friday the 30. The Parliaments Army cam to herifford
frõ Worster, Henry Gray, Earle of Stamford, ye
Generall. On Tewsday morning October 4 captain
Hamon and his barons company plundered Mr. Geereses
house at Garnons, both them and me of much Goods,
toke a way my 2 bay coache mares and som money, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
much Linen: and Elyza Acton’s clothes. I cam frõ
Garnons ye same Tewsday to Mr. John Garpinder’s to
Hinton, a mile off, and staied there till the 14 of
December following.”</p></blockquote>

<p>From place to place this good lady went seeking
safety. She was reduced to having her clothes
hidden in different places.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“January 7 feare of ye plunderers gave goody Lawrence
for keeping clothes of myne and Eliza Actons (a young
lady who lived with her) in ye hill for feare 1<sup>s</sup>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When she could not save her apparel from falling
into the enemy’s hands, she managed sometimes to
redeem it, as in the following <span class="locked">case:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Paid Mathias Rafford w^{ch} he laid out to redeeme
my 2 black bever Hatts, and 2 gould bands out of ye
theefes or plunderers hand, they took at Garnons 21/6.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Soldiers had meantime been quartered in her
house in Hereford, where she had left her maidservants,
and whither Miss Eliza Acton seems to
have gone from time to time to keep things in
order. When the Royalists triumphed and established
a garrison in the city, Mistress Jefferies paid
her quota for the support of the soldiers. She
was one of the richest householders in the city.
The victory of the Royalists was short-lived,
for in 1643 Hereford was again besieged by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Parliamentary forces. So things went on for a
couple of years, and Mistress Jefferies had to consent
to see her comfortable house in the outskirts
of the city razed to the ground to make room for
military operations when another siege was expected.
Far from grumbling at her own misfortunes,
she was always ready to lend a helping hand
to her neighbours. The income derived from her
estates was seized by those other “plunderers,” the
Parliamentary Committee, who doled out to her
some portion of her own property, imposing fines
simply because she was a Royalist.</p>

<p>A distant relative of Mistress Jefferies was reduced
to the most abject poverty during this period.
This was a Mrs. Conyngesby, whose husband was
sheriff of the county of Hereford, and also the
owner of Hampton Court. Before the war broke
out he had been burdened with debts, and during
the early years of the Commonwealth, while he was
absent from England, his family were reduced
almost to beggary. Mrs. Conyngesby was constantly
besieging the authorities who received
petitions in Goldsmiths’ Hall, begging for one-fifth
part of her husband’s estates, for her children were
wanting food. These kinds of petitions were continually
pouring in at Goldsmiths’ Hall, and though
orders were given for money to be paid, much laxity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
was shown in the execution, and the wretched petitioners
were kept for weary months in suspense and
privation, and deemed themselves fortunate if they
secured anything from the general wreck.</p>

<p>A foremost figure in the troubles going on in
Ireland while war was raging in England was
Lady Ranelagh, daughter of the first Earl of Cork.
Through her persuasions her husband was induced
to change sides and come over from the King to
the Parliament. He became a genuine supporter
of Cromwell, giving up to the common cause five
castles, and also aiding the Parliamentary forces
with men and arms. His family were, in consequence,
reduced to great straits, and in 1646 Lady
Ranelagh petitioned Parliament for some support.
The sum of £6 a-week was allowed her for four
years, and after this she had £4 a-week up to 1653.
In spite of her anti-Stuart feelings, she was a good
friend to those of the other side who were in distress.
The eldest son of Lord Clarendon, who,
after the Revolution, was involved in a plot for the
restoration of James II., owed much to her good
offices, as did also the second son who proclaimed
himself in favour of the hereditary line of sovereigns,
and was in danger of losing his government pension.
Through Lady Ranelagh’s friendship with Bishop
Burnet, who used his good offices with the Queen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
the offence was passed over. Lady Ranelagh, on
the other hand, made efforts to save the life of
Lord William Russell, and tried to help those persecuted
for religion like William Riffin, who was
arrested by order of the Duke of Buckingham for
preaching in a Baptist chapel.</p>

<p>It will be seen how frequently women were
called upon to take a personal and decisive part in
the great struggle of the seventeenth century.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There was no security against the lawlessness of the
soldiery, who availed themselves (on both sides) of the
slightest pretext for entering private houses, and plundering
and menacing the inhabitants. A suspicion of disaffection
either way, or the possession of arms or gunpowder, was
excuse enough for violence and rapine. Unprotected
widows, or ladies left in charge of mansions and domains
while their husbands were out levying troops, offered
irresistible temptation to the scattered parties of half-fed
troops that went marauding hungrily over the country.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Two sisters wrote the following appeal to
General <span class="locked">Fairfax:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“May it please your Excellency to vouchsafe me and
my sister Ann your honourable favour and protection for
our goods, and that we may not suffer though my brother
hath broke his promise with your lordship; which I vow
my Lord, I was altogether ignorant of, and it grieves me
infinitely; for that we have ever found your lordship so
noble a friend to our house. Therefore I beseech your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
lordship to commiserate our cases who are left orphans,
and for my dear deceased father’s sake, who loved and
honoured your lordship truly, let us not, who are innocent,
suffer; but that your wonted goodness and favour may
still reflect and shine upon us, by which you shall oblige
us ever to remain my Lord,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l1">“Your lordship’s most humble servants,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Mary Middleton</span>,<br />
“<span class="smcap">Ann Middleton</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Parliament were very much afraid of the
leading women in the Royalist party, and to undermine
their influence and prevent communication,
orders were given that certain ladies should be
removed from their homes. Colonel Chomeley
was directed particularly to get Lady Musgrave
out of the way. A letter was sent from William
Roe, Secretary to the Commissioners, dated from
Newcastle, April 12, <span class="locked">1645&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Whereas we are informed that the wives of sundry of
our enemies in Carlisle are remaining at their own houses
in Cumberland and Westmoreland, from whence they may
give intelligence of all that passeth amongst yourselves,
and are ready to stir the vil humours and to improve all
discontents, to the raising up of tumults, and bringing in
confusion with the people and inhabitants their neighbours,
round about them: we think fit and hereby order that
Colonel Chomeley shall take care to apprehend all such
persons as he may have just cause to suspect to be stirrers
up of sedition and insurrection; that in particular he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
repair to the Lady Musgrave at Eden Hall, and conduct
her to Carlisle, where she may remain with her husband,
Sir Philip Musgrave, in more security than in her house at
Eden Hall, in these tumultuous and troublesome times;
and of this service we expect an account as speedily as
may be.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Lady Musgrave, whose husband, Sir Philip
Musgrave, was a staunch Royalist, addressed the
following remonstrance to Lord <span class="locked">Fairfax:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have formerly received your lordship’s protection
for my remaining at Eden Hall, if I be obedient to ordinance
of Parliament, which they cannot tax me, for my
accusation is suspicion of intelligence, without desert or
proof. Colonel Chomeley hath orders for my removing.
I did desire the stay of us till I knew your honour’s
pleasure. Eden Hall is my jointure, where my humble
suit is to remain, being very unfit for travel. But I wholly
refer myself to your lordship’s pleasure, both for means,
and what place I and my children may remain together
at, presuming that your honourable favour and worth will
consider my poor condition, which shall ever oblige me
to be,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">“Your most obedient servant,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Julian Musgrave</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Another instance of the prominent part which
women were compelled to take in the stormy
politics of the seventeenth century, may be found
in the life of Lady Anne Halkett, the daughter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Thomas Murray, who was Secretary to Charles I.
when Prince of Wales. It was Mistress Anne who,
at the request of Colonel Bamfield, assisted the
Duke of York to escape from St. James’s Palace.
She caused a female costume to be made for the
duke by her own tailor, having first procured the
necessary measurements from Colonel Bamfield.
There was a little awkwardness about this initial
proceeding, for the tailor much wondered at the
directions given him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When I gave the measure to my tailor to inquire how
much mohaire would serve to make a petticoate and wastcoate
to a young gentlewoman of that bignesse and stature,
hee considered itt a long time, and said hee had many
gownes and suites, butt hee had never made any to such
a person in his life. I thought hee was in the right, butt
his meaning was, hee had never seene any woman of so
lowe a stature have so big a waste; however hee made itt
as exactly fitt as if hee had taken the measure himselfe.
It was a mixed mohaire of a light haire colour and blacke,
and ye under petticoate was scarlett.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was arranged that the duke should make
his escape on the evening of April 20, 1648.
The duke was accustomed to play at hide and
seek with his attendants after supper, and this game
was employed to cover his flight. Colonel Bamfield
waited at the garden gate of the palace, and conveyed
the duke to a house that he had hired, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
the costume was in readiness, and Mistress Anne
and another were waiting in great anxiety.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I had many feares,” she writes, “for Colonel Bamfield
had desired me, if they came nott there precisely by ten
a’clocke, to shift for myselfe, for then I might conclude
they were discovered, and soe my stay there could doe no
good, but prejudice my selfe. Yett this did nott make me
leave the howse, though ten a’clocke did strike, and hee
that was intrusted offten wentt to the landing place, and
saw no boate comming was much discouraged, and asked
mee what I would doe. I told him I came there with
a resolution to save his Highnesse, and I was fully determined
nott to leave that place till I was outt of hopes of
doing what I came there for, and would take my hazard.
Hee left me to go againe to ye watter-side, and heard
a great noise of many as I thought comming up staires,
which I expected to be soldiers to take mee, but it was
a pleasing disapointmentt, for ye first that came in was
ye Duke, who with much joy I took in my armes and gave
God thankes for his safe arrivall. His Highnese called
‘Quickely, quickely, dress me,’ and putting off his cloaths
I dressed him in the women’s habitt that was prepared,
which fitted his Highnese very well, and was pretty in itt.
After hee had eaten something I made ready while I was
idle lest his Highnese should be hungry, and having sent
for a Woodstreet cake (which I knew he loved) to take in
the barge, with as much hast as could bee his Highnese
wentt crose the bridge to ye stairs where the large barge
lay, Colonel Bamfield leading him; and immediately the
boatmen plied the oare so well that they weare soone out
of sight, having both wind and tyde with ym.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
The duke was not missed at first, his attendants
supposing he had found some secure hiding-place.
But as time sped on a thorough search was made,
and the Earl of Northumberland, who had charge
of the duke, sent to acquaint the Speaker of the
House of Commons. Orders were given to stop
and search all ships leaving the Cinque Ports, but
the clerks employed to write the instructions were
slow in making out the papers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“None of them were able to writt one right, butt ten or
twelve of y<sup>m</sup> were cast by before one was according to
their mind.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">So the orders arrived too late.</p>

<p>In 1653 Mistress Anne Murray, while staying
in Edinburgh, rendered an important service to the
Earl of Balcarres, who was in danger of arrest. She
undertook to warn him, and started early in the
morning attended by a man-servant, reaching the
Earl’s residence before ten o’clock. Lord and Lady
Balcarres immediately left the house, and at their
request Mistress Murray stayed with the children
and packed up the books in trunks, for the Earl
had a very fine library.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I was very desirous,” she writes, “to serve them faithfully
in what I was intrusted, and as soone as my Lord and
Lady were gone, I made locke up the gates, and with
ye helpe of Logan who served my Lord, and one of ye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
women, both beeing very trusty, I tooke downe all ye
bookes, and putting them in trunkes and chests, sentt them
all outt of the house in the night to the places appointed
by my Lord, taking a short way of inventory to know
what sort of bookes were sentt to every person.... The
things had nott been two houres outt of the house when
the troope of horse came and asked for my Lord....
They searched all the house, and seeing nothing in itt
butt bare walls and weemen and children, they wentt
away.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Just before the Restoration, in February, 1660,
when Monk caused the secluded members to be
re-admitted to what was called a Free Parliament,
there was great excitement among the country
gentlemen. One of the most notable politicians
was Lady Rochester, whose son, Sir Henry Lee,
was a candidate. She writes to her friend Mr.
Thomas Yates, on February <span class="locked">23&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This day I received a letter from you with all the
good newes in it, for which I give you thanks, and also
for the care you tell me you have taken for my sonne
Lee’s being chosen a Parliament man in the next election.
I was formerly spoken to for Mr. Appletree, whome I
must now lay absolutely aside by reason that Sir Ralphe
Verney desires to bee one, who is a person whose owne
merits is such, as it will bee a happinesse to the place, and
they will have cause to give us thanks for him; besides,

to divest him I shall desire it for his sonne. Good Mr.

faile of being chosen. What you shall say to the people
of the place to encourage them to it, I shall leave to your

<span class="l4">“Your friend and servant,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Anne Rochester</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Lady Rochester was a person of influence, and
was besieged by applications for help. A little
later she writes <span class="locked">again&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Here is such a doe about providing for burgeses

Solicitors for those places in the children’s estate that it

</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Turning from England to Scotland, we find
women playing a notable part at a later period,
when the House of Stuart again involved the
country in civil war. The Jacobites kept up a
political ferment from the time when James II. was
impelled to lay down his crown and fly, to the death
of his grandson Prince Charlie. The Young Pretender,
who has been variously described as the
pink of chivalry and a worthless debauchee, was the
object of a very real and practical enthusiasm. In
Scotland, ladies of rank and wealth enlisted eagerly
in his cause. There is very little that is admirable
in such partisans of Prince Charlie as Lady Ogilvie
and the Duchess of Perth beyond their dauntless
courage. But if half the men who flocked to
the Young Pretender’s standard had been filled
with the fiery spirit of those two notorious Scotchwomen,
the course of political events would have
been altered. As it was, they materially influenced
the action of the leaders of the rebel party. Had
it not been for the Duchess, the Duke of Perth
would have been but a lukewarm adherent, and
certainly would never have bestirred himself to
raise a troop for the Prince on his own estate.
But the Duchess shamed him into action. She
herself went about for three days and nights
collecting recruits, and when she had mustered seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
hundred and fifty, she caused the Chevalier, as he
was called, to be proclaimed by sound of bagpipes
and hunting-horns from the walls of Castle
Drummond. She accompanied the Scotch army to
England, and when the expected reinforcements
failed to appear at Carlisle, she told the hesitating
Duke that if he turned back she would lead the
men herself. She had not only to overcome her
husband’s timidity, but to contend with the weakness
of the Prince. When he talked of a retreat
at Derby, she expressed her disgust in no measured
terms, and gave him clearly to understand that she
thought him a coward.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“If,” said the indignant lady, “I had as many women in
my train as the Prince has men in his, I would not turn
my back upon all the power the enemy could bring up.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Much against her will, she was forced into the rear
at the battle of Culloden, and was ultimately taken
prisoner.</p>

<p>Her friend, Lady Ogilvie, was likewise always
to be found wherever fighting was going on. She
was present at the battle of Falkirk and at the
siege of Stirling; but, unfortunately, her ferocity
of temper marred the excellence of her courage.
Her political foes were enemies for whom no
measure of retaliation was too harsh. Lady Ogilvie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
like the Duchess of Perth, was taken prisoner after
Culloden, though she was not present at the battle.</p>

<p>But the heroine of the Jacobite rising was the
famous Flora McDonald. The gentle but high-spirited
girl, whose name has become a household
word, was far from being a politician. When the
Prince of Wales visited her in London after her
release from the Tower, she said very frankly that
she only acted towards Prince Charlie as she
would have acted towards his Royal Highness
himself had their positions been reversed. Womanly
compassion moved her to imperil her life and the
prospects of her family to relieve the distresses of
a fugitive prince. At the same time she shared
the enthusiasm of her country for the house of
Stuart. The romantic story of her journey with
Prince Charlie attired as her Irish maid-servant
has been fully told in other pages.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Her want
of precaution in not stopping the mouths of the
boatmen led to her arrest. Two weary months
she spent in prison in Scotland, and was then
conveyed to London and confined in the Tower.
From this ominous fortress she was removed and
placed in charge of a private family, where the
Prince of Wales made his totally unexpected visit.
Her candour so impressed him that he advised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
she should be restored to her friends. A free
pardon was sent her, and Flora McDonald became
the lioness of the London season. To the young
Scotch gentlewoman, unaccustomed to the turmoil
of fashionable life, and loving the freedom and
solitude of the moors, London society soon became
oppressive. She <span class="locked">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To be in the fashion in London, the people appeared
to me to live more out of their houses than in them; in
the afternoon visiting, driving in their family coaches,
attending sale-rooms where trumpery articles were sold
by auction to the highest bidder, sometimes really
scarcely worth taking home; for the principal part of
the amusement consisted in the ladies outbidding each
other, and generally amongst friends, so that large sums
of money used to change hands in this frivolous way,
which, no doubt, made their husbands very cross. However,
the town ladies would, and I suppose ever will,
contrive to have their own way. Then came the formal
dinner-parties&mdash;oh, how I used to yawn behind my fan!&mdash;and
often we went to see the play in Drury Lane, and, if it
chanced to be a mournful tragedy, I could not help being
so silly as to cry, it all seemed so natural and life-like.
The best actor was Mr. Garrick, and he certainly was
a great man in his profession. Mr. Cibber also was
wonderfully clever: these were the first stage performers
at that time....”</p></blockquote>

<p>She goes on to describe how soon she tired
of the constant whirl of London fashionable life,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
out all day driving from house to house, and every
night at some place.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I was sick,” she declares, “of the compliments paid
me; indeed, in many cases the attentions of the gentlemen
went beyond compliments.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Presently this brilliant figure disappears from
English society, and the heroine returns to her
native land to marry her kinsman, Allan McDonald,
and to become the mother of the celebrated Sir
John McDonald.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MARTYR PERIODS: RELIGIOUS ZEAL AND RELIGIOUS APATHY.</span></h2>

century&mdash;Persecution of the Quakeresses&mdash;Quaker

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">The</span> religious history of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries is notorious for comprising two
great periods of martyrdom&mdash;periods which are
significant as showing the strong latent force in
women, waiting for opportunity to call it forth.
Whatever position may be assigned to women
either by the Church or the State, whatever may
have been the current notions about the place they
should occupy, however much they may have
been repressed or neglected, they have always
been ready, when occasion arose, to respond to
the call for action. In times of political struggle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
of fierce fighting, they have been eager to spend
and be spent, enthusiastic, persistent, unflinching.
In the cause of religion, which, above all others,
appeals to women, their zeal has been most conspicuous.</p>

<p>It has been elsewhere noted that throughout
the Middle Ages the Church was the dominant
force.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> All over Europe the unity of Christendom
was the central idea, binding men together in
spite of the rents caused by war. In the sixteenth
century this idea was overthrown. Christendom
was divided, never again to be welded into one.
Yet the unloosening of the bonds which had held
the laity in subjection to ecclesiastical authority, did
not subvert the influence of religion itself among
the people. As an interest religion occupied a
large place in the lives of all classes. Those who
had leisure used it for the study of theology and
religious literature; among women the literary
efforts of that period were chiefly concerned with
devotional matters. Liberty awakened an ardour
more intense. A new power was given to the
people&mdash;the right of private judgment. It brought
with it an overwhelming sense of responsibility.
Questions that had before been decided by an
infallible authority were left to be solved by each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
one for himself. Religion became for the first
time a matter dependent on personal conviction
and understanding. The priest no longer stood
as interpreter between the individual and his faith.</p>

<p>All the influences of the period, the literary
movement, the awakening forces of the Renaissance,
the stress and stir in the whole national life, added
to rather than diminished the strength of the
religious emotion. It might have been supposed
that people would have been lax and indifferent in
a period of so much general activity, when new
vistas were opening out in the social horizon. But
the sixteenth century was not a time of apathy in
any department of life, and the religious question
which was agitating the whole Continent burned
fiercer than ever in England on account of the
increased mental activity.</p>

<p>With women who embraced the reformed faith,
religion was the dominating force. All their
enthusiasm awoke. To those with a strong spiritual
bias the question of belief became the most supreme
matter of concern. To be false to conscience was
to poison the very root of their being. The Roman
Catholic martyrs died loyally in the service of the
Church&mdash;that Church which was tottering from
blows without and corruption within&mdash;they died as
servants of a spiritual power that had ruled Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
The glamour attaching to the traditions of a Church
which had had no rival in Christendom hung round
their faith. The Protestant martyrs died like
soldiers in a cause which they had espoused from
intense conviction of its rightness. They died
exultingly for a belief which had become the mainspring
of their lives, which was a personal possession,
a deep spiritual experience. In these martyr periods
we see the apotheosis of the religious sentiment in
women.</p>

<p>The abnormal character of the martyr periods
makes them stand out from the general course of
history. They are not evolutionary, except in the
sense in which all events spring from causes, and all
phenomena, whether material or spiritual, are part
of a chain of circumstances. In the attitude of the
Church towards women during religious persecutions,
there are no features which are not characteristic of
the attitude of the Church to the general body of
the laity. During these periods differences of sex
are obliterated. The perfervid zeal and fanaticism
which inspired to persecution suspended all ordinary
relations.</p>

<p>It has also to be remembered that the martyr
spirit was not the spirit of the general body of the
people. The population was not divided into two
parts, of which the larger were the persecuted and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
the smaller the persecutors. The mass held a
neutral position, and displayed neither heroism nor
bloodthirstiness. The martyrs and zealots were
few compared with those who escaped notice
altogether.</p>

<p>The martyr periods certainly show what a much
greater motive-power religion was than in more
peaceful times, when other forces competed for
mastery over the human mind; and they afford
endless speculation to the student of mental and
moral phenomena. As regards women, it is only in
these times of religious upheaval that the Church
recognized their perfect equality with men.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the history of the persecutions
that applies more particularly to women than
to men. Both suffered alike, and displayed what
seems to those who live in an age when all religions
are tolerated, a fanatical devotion to forms of faith
as well as the loftiest courage and fortitude. The
persecutors made no distinction of sex. A woman,
by reason of being a heretic or a Papist, as the case
might be, was at once elevated to a position of
unenviable distinction. In ordinary times neither
the Roman nor the Protestant Church recognized
an equality of rights between men and women.
The Romanists kept women in subjection, and
curtailed their liberty of action and thought; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Protestants checked their means of usefulness by
neglect. But neither had power to damp religious
zeal, and when the hour of peril came, women
showed an unwavering spirit and a fearless independence.</p>

<p>It may also be noted, in passing, that while the
Roman Church proclaimed the inferiority of women,
and put a low value on their intellectual powers, it
treated their deviations from its doctrine with the
same rigour as if they had been endowed with the
superior attributes of the other sex. Women’s
weakness, mental and moral, availed them nothing.
They were subjected to interrogatories as searching
and tortures as severe as men. No excuse was
made for their want of reason and understanding,
and the greatest pains were taken to convince them
of error. During the Lollard persecutions in 1389,
an anchoress known to be tainted with the new
opinions was carried from Leicester to Wolverhampton,
was closely immured and examined by
no less a magnate than Courtney, Archbishop of
Canterbury, who, either by threat or persuasion,
prevailed upon this erring sister to recant her
heresy.</p>

<p>In 1459 the monks of Bath were greatly excited
by hearing that a woman, an inhabitant of the city,
had spoken slightingly of <span class="locked">the&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“holy mummeries that were carried on in the Church of
Bath, and the pilgrimages made by the devotees to the
different sacred edifices in the neighbourhood. This was
wounding the monks in the tenderest part; and as the
offence militated directly against their influence and
interest, it demanded a severe and exemplary punishment.
A proper representation of this heinous crime being made
to the ecclesiastical court at Wells, it was decreed that she
should recant in the great church at Bath, before all the
congregation, the heretical and disrespectful words she had
spoken against the superstitions of the latter city and
some neighbouring places, which had been to this effect:
that it was but waste to give to the Holy Trinity at Bath,
and equally absurd to go on pilgrimages to St. Osmund at
Salisbury; and that she wished the road thither was
choaked up with (bremmel) brambles and thorns to (lette)
prevent people from going thither.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The questioning to which the Protestant martyrs
of the sixteenth century were subjected was very
minute. With a notable heretic like Anne Askew,
who was burnt at Smithfield, July 16, 1546, the
dignitaries of the Church spent hours of discussion
day after day, and women who were of no renown
whatever were cross-examined in much detail.</p>

<p>Among the Roman Catholics women of the
trading class suffered persecution because they could
not bring themselves to acquiesce in the new form of
worship. The wife of a miller in All Hallows parish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
refused to go to church because, she said, there was
“neither priest, altar, nor sacrifice;” and many
women who showed a similar spirit may be found
among the wives of tailors, locksmiths, tanners, and
others of similar standing. Pressure was put upon
tradesmen, yeomen, and husbandmen to ensure the
conformity of their wives.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“The common people of England,” it was said in derision,
“were wiser than the wisest of the nation; for here the
very women and shopkeepers were able to judge of predestination,
and determine what laws were to be made
concerning Church government.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Anne Askew was arrested in March, 1545, and
brought before Christopher Dare at Sadlers’ Hall,
Cheapside, on the charge of denying transubstantiation,
the eighteenth article of the statute. She
was afterwards examined by the Lord Mayor, by
the Bishop of London’s chaplain, by Bishop
Bonner, by Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, and
Lord Chancellor Wriothesley, none of whom could
shake her convictions or induce her to retract, and
she was accordingly burnt at the stake. Anne
Askew was of good social position, the daughter of
a knight, Sir William Askew, and a maid of honour
to Queen Catherine Parr.</p>

<p>It was not only a rapt enthusiasm and ecstatic
fervour which sustained women in the hour of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
martyrdom. There is plenty of evidence of that
comprehending courage which could anticipate
and prepare for death with the same calmness as
for any ordinary event of life. The dying speeches
of the women who suffered from the merciless
brutality of Judge Jeffreys are very remarkable.
That of the aged Lady Alicia de Lisle, who was
barbarously executed in 1685, after the battle of
Sedgmoor, for sheltering fugitives, is one of the
most <span class="locked">notable&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Gentlemen, Friends, and Neighbours, it may be expected
that I should say something at my death, and
in order thereunto I shall acquaint you that my birth
and education were both near this place, and that my
parents instructed me in the fear of God, and I now die
of the Reformed Protestant Religion; believing that if
ever popery should return into this nation, it would be
a very great and severe judgment.... The crime that
was laid to my charge was for entertaining a Nonconformist
Minister and others in my house; the said
minister being sworn to have been in the late Duke of
Monmouth’s Army.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“I have no excuse but surprise and fear, which I
believe my Jury must make use of to excuse their verdict
to the world. I have been also told that the Court
did use to be of counsel for the prisoner; but instead
of advice, I had evidence against me from thence; which,
though it were only by hearing, might possibly affect
my Jury; my defence being such as might be expected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
from a weak woman; but, such as it was, I did not hear
it repeated again to the Jury, which, as I have been
informed, is usual in such cases. However, I forgive all
the world, and therein all those that have done me
wrong.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Another victim, Mrs. Gaunt of Wapping, who
was burnt in the same year for a somewhat similar
offence, wrote the day before her <span class="locked">martyrdom&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Not knowing whether I should be suffered or able
because of weaknesses that are upon me through my
hard and close imprisonment, to speak at the place of
execution; I writ these few lines to signifie that I am
well reconciled to the way of my God towards me,
though it be in ways I looked not for, and by terrible
things, yet in righteousness.”</p></blockquote>

<p>She goes on to write a long speech expressive
of her religious faith and her entire lack of regret
for anything that she had done in succouring the
poor, “... I did but relieve an unworthy poor
distressed family, and lo, I must die for it.”</p>

<p>She puts a postscript: “Such as it is you have
it from her who hath done as she could, and is
sorry she can do no better.”</p>

<p>The Quakers went through their period of
martyrdom in the seventeenth century. In the
midst of a heterogeneous state of religious parties,
the Quaker movement stands out with great distinctness
as the only religious movement in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
women were recognized as leaders and teachers.
The Quakers began to preach in London about the
year 1654, five years after George Fox’s imprisonment.
Both in England and in America, whither
numbers emigrated, they endured violent persecution.
The first Quakers who went to Boston
were two women who sailed in 1656. They were
imprisoned and maltreated, were deprived of food
and light, had their books seized and burnt, and
all sorts of indignities practised upon them. The
reign of Charles II. was an exceedingly troublous
time for Quakers in England, though they had
been promised immunity from molestation in their
meetings, both by General Monk and by Charles
when he came to the throne. In the first year
of the preaching in London two women, who undertook
to distribute a pamphlet written by George
Fox and called “The Kingdom of Heaven,” were
arrested and sent to Bridewell prison.</p>

<p>As their numbers increased, so did their troubles.
Quakers have never been noted for active proselytizing,
but their well-ordered lives made a greater
impression than exhortation and argument.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Thus continuing to live in fear and a reverential
awe, they improved in true godliness; insomuch that
by their pious lives they preached as well as others
with words. After this manner the number of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
society increased: but then grievous sufferings ensued; for
the priests could not endure to see that their hearers
left them; the furious mob was spurred on, and among
the magistrates there were many who, being of a fierce
temper, used all their strength to root out the professors
of the light (as they were called at first), and to suppress
and stifle their doctrine; but all proved in vain, as
appears abundantly from their history; although there
were hardly any prisons in England where some of
these people were not shut up; besides the spoil of goods
and cruel whippings that befell some of them. Yet all
this they bore with a more than ordinary courage without
making resistance, how great soever their number
was; and notwithstanding many of them had been
valiant soldiers, who often had slain their enemies in the
field without regarding danger.”</p></blockquote>

<p>That the women endured an abundant share
of the persecutions and martyrdoms which befell
the Society is proved by the records. They were
scourged and ill treated in every possible way.
Not only did they endure great suffering, but
took active steps in trying to rescue their fellow-members
from evil plight. When George Fox
was apprehended, in 1660, at the house of one
Margaret Fell, a widow of Judge Fell, at Swarthmore
(Lancashire), his entertainer, accompanied by
another Friend, Anne Curtis, procured an interview
with the king. Anne Curtis gained the
royal ear through being the daughter of a Bristol<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
sheriff who had been hanged for his devotion to
the Stuarts.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Not much came of the interview,
however, for, although the king was ready enough
to listen, and gave an order for Fox to be brought
up, it was evaded, and a delay of two months
ensued.</p>

<p>Barbara Blangdon, who suffered persecution and
imprisonment for her preaching in the west of
England in 1654, made an effort, as soon as her
own release was effected, to procure that of two
other members at Basingstoke, and was successful,
through her intercession with the mayor.</p>

<p>In 1656 two Quakeresses were placed in the
stocks at Evesham by the mayor, with every
circumstance of indignity, for visiting some
prisoners. Two years before, the Oxford scholars
so violently maltreated two Quakeresses who
preached in the streets that one of them succumbed
shortly after. With the end of the seventeenth
century persecutions for the most part ceased, and
a period of quiescence set in. There was a good
deal of discussion going on in the eighteenth
century anent Quakerism, and many satires and
skits were issued against the sect, but it was a war
of words only.</p>

<p>The Quakers always maintained the equality of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
women with men in religious matters. It was one
of the cardinal articles of their belief.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“As we dare not encourage any ministry but that which
we believe to spring from the influence of the Holy Spirit,
so neither dare we to attempt to restrain this ministry to
persons of any condition in life, or to the male sex alone;
but as male and female are one in Christ, we hold it proper
that such of the female sex as we believe to be endued
with a right qualification for the ministry should exercise
their gifts for the general edification of the Church.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The first woman among the Quakers to preach
in London was Ann Downer, afterwards married
to George Whitehead. Private residences were
frequently used as places of worship, and women
are often mentioned as lending their houses for this
purpose.</p>

<p>Women, being able to exercise the function of
preaching, were naturally prominent in other departments
of work.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“As we believe women may be rightly called to the work
of the ministry,” say the Friends, “we also think that to
them belongs a share in the support of our Christian
discipline: and that some parts of it, wherein their own
sex is concerned, devolve on them with peculiar propriety.
Accordingly they have monthly, quarterly, and yearly
meetings of their own sex, held at the same time with
those of the men; but separately, and without the power
of making rules; and it may be remarked that during the
persecutions which formerly occasioned the imprisonment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
of so many of the men, the care of the poor fell on to the
women, and was by them satisfactorily administered.”</p></blockquote>

<p>They have always continued to maintain the
right of women to become preachers, a right which
seemed an exceedingly strange one, in the last
century, to members of other religious bodies.
The Quakers were quite aware of the weak points
in their adversaries’ armour, and quick to perceive
the ground of the objection against their own
broader view of the position of women.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There is yet another strong prejudice against women’s
preaching,” says one of the Quaker <cite>Dissertations</cite>, “and
this no less than the united interest of the whole body of
men called clergymen. For if, say they, the pastoral
function may be exercised by laymen and even women,
then we shall be deemed no longer necessary, nay, perhaps,
down goes our trade, our pomp, and revenues. And,
indeed, it is hardly credible to me that these men would
have ever made the opposition that some of them have
done to a woman’s preaching Jesus in a sensible manner,
if preaching were a profession which there was nothing to
be got by.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Anglican clergy of the seventeenth century
bore a high character for learning. “The ordinary
sort of our English clergy,” wrote Eachard, “do far
excel in learning the common priests of the Church
of Rome.” Atterbury is still more emphatic. He
declares that “for depth of learning, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
other things, the English clergy is not to be paralleled
in the whole Christian world.” Yet Edward
Chamberlayne<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> affirms that “they are less respected
generally than any in Europe;” and both Bishop
Burnet and Bishop Stillingfleet bewail the contempt
with which the clergy were regarded as “too
notorious not to be observed.”</p>

<p>The Anglican Church did not leaven the nation
as the Roman Church had done by works of charity
and benevolence. It was remarkably indifferent to
social work and religious propagandism, outside the
doors of the church. The traditions of the Roman
Church were not carried on by the Protestants, who
probably felt a repugnance to any methods adopted
by their enemies, the Papists.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“Not only were Anglicans destitute of any associations of
lay helpers in Christian work at home, and of any means
for carrying on missions abroad, but Puritans were in the
same predicament.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That there were many abuses connected with
the old system of almsgiving at the convent gate
cannot be doubted, and it was impossible, in a fast-growing
nation, that such a state of things should
continue; but the Anglican Church lost one of its
great holds on the people by indifference to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
offices of charity. The State had begun, in a
partial and imperfect way, in the sixteenth century,
to assume the care of the poor. The beginnings
of the old poor-law system may be traced to the
reign of Elizabeth. But the State was a poor
foster-mother. The Protestant Church made no
organized effort to become to the masses what the
Roman Church had been. It assumed none of that
absolute authority combined with paternal care. It
is true that the ideal set up by George Herbert of
the country parson is that of a true father of his
flock.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“He first considers his own parish; and takes care that
there be not a beggar or idle person in his parish, but that
all be in a competent way of getting their living. This he
effects either by bounty or persuasion, or by authority;
making use of that excellent Statute which binds all
parishes to maintain their own. If his parish be rich, he
exacts this of them; if poor, and he be able, he easeth
them therein. But he gives no set pension to any.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There was little of what is now called Church
work. And the clergy do not seem to have thought
of enlisting the aid of women in the few tentative
efforts put forth during the seventeenth century.
It may be urged that the fault lay with the women,
who did not come forward or show their willingness
to co-operate. There was no encouragement for
them to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“The tendencies of the period were not favourable to the
development of women’s work in the Church. Nor was it
the fashion for women to occupy a prominent position.
Women played small part in the life of the nation at
large. In none of the societies formed for missionary,
devotional, or philanthropic objects did women take a
leading part. The only attempt to form an organization
of women was nipped in the bud.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This attempt refers, probably, to the effort made by
Mrs. Mary Astell to set up a “Protestant Nunnery,”
of which further mention will be made.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, an establishment founded
by a certain Nicholas Ferrar, some time in the first
half of the century, at Little Gidding, in Huntingdonshire,
which was called a Protestant nunnery.
But it was little more than the setting up of the
conventual rule in an ordinary household.</p>

<p>In 1642 Parliament seemed to think it necessary
that something should be done to improve the
religious life of the country, and accordingly, on
April <span class="locked">7&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“the Lords and Commons doe declare that they intend a
due and necessary reformation of the government and
liturgie of the Church, and to take nothing away in the
one or in the other, but what shall be evill or justly offensive,
or at least unnecessary and burdensome. And for the
better effecting thereof, speedily to have consultation with
godly and learned divines; and because this will never of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
itselfe attein the end sought therein, they will therefore use
their utmost endevors to establish learned and preaching
ministers with a good and sufficient maintenance throughout
the whole kingdome, wherein many darke corners are
miserablie destitute of the meanes of salvation, and many
poore ministers want necessary provision.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The saintly George Herbert, who lived through
the first quarter of the seventeenth century, makes
a mild protest against the cringing attitude adopted
by that section of the clergy who took upon themselves
the duties of domestic chaplain to wealthy
families. In many, if not most, houses the chaplain
was put on a par with the upper servants, and
expected to show the same deference towards the
employers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Those that live in noble houses,” writes Herbert,
“are called chaplains; whose duty and obligation being the
same to the houses they live in as a parson’s to his parish,
in describing the one (which is indeed the bent of my
discourse) the other will be manifest. Let not chaplains
think themselves so free as many of them do; and because
they have different names think their office different.
Doubtless they are parsons of the families they live in,
and are entertained to that end, either by an open or
implicit covenant. Before they are in Orders they may be
received for companions or discoursers; but after a man is
once minister he cannot agree to come into any house
where he shall not exercise what he is, unless he forsake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
his plough and look back. Therefore they are not to be
over-submissive and base, but to keep up with the lord and
lady of the house, and to preserve a boldness with them
and all, even so far as reproof to their very face when
occasion calls, but seasonably and discreetly.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The subservience of the clergy as a class, and
the slights put upon them, arose partly from their
poverty, which was treated like a fault. In 1670,
writes Eachard, £20 or £30 a-year was as much
as hundreds of the clergy could obtain. In the
beginning of the eighteenth century there were
some benefices, says Henry Wharton, not above £5
a-year in value, some hundreds not over £20, and
some thousands not more than £30. Dean Swift
puts the average income of a vicar at £40.</p>

<p>Whether rightly or wrongly, the bulk of the
clergy in the seventeenth century seem to have
enjoyed little of the prestige attaching to the
priestly office, and their social position showed some
curious anomalies. It was not because they were
out of harmony with the national life. The higher
clergy who were in possession of fat livings were,
naturally, on good terms with the world, and were
quite in sympathy with the tastes and habits of
their neighbours, not merely countenancing but
sharing in the amusements of the laity. But they
did nothing to win esteem for and raise the status<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
of the lower, ill-paid clergy, who appear on the
whole to have been hard-working and well-intentioned,
with a fellow-feeling for the cares and
burdens of their parishioners. Between the fox-hunting
bishops and canons and the out-at-elbows
country parsons there was a large body of learned,
scholarly divines, who reflected lustre on their class.
But as a power in social life, the Anglican Church
could not bear comparison with the Roman Church.
In the first place, an authority which laid no claim
to infallibility could not exercise the same influence
as one that asserted its supremacy over all matters
temporal and spiritual. And, in addition, Protestantism
favoured independence of thought. This was
more observable in the sects outside the Anglican
Church. Narrow as was the creed of the Presbyterians
and that of the other dissenting bodies
which sprang up later, it was a creed held by
conviction; it was acquired, not merely accepted.</p>

<p>As far as women were concerned, the result of
the theological change was that, while there were
numerous examples of individual piety, there was
no attempt at organized religious work. Both
inside the Anglican Church and in the ranks of the
Puritans there were women noted for their zeal and
active benevolence. But neither Anglicans nor
Puritans sought, like the Romanists, to turn the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
great engine of woman’s power to systematic use.
To the Puritans religion was a personal affair, in
which faith counted for more than works. As for
the Anglican Church, it was, in the seventeenth
century, hampered by too many difficulties (among
which may be counted the formalism of many of
its own ministers) to attempt any social work.
Indeed, the teaching of Church doctrine was
neglected in many places, and, according to John
<span class="locked">Evelyn&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“people had no principles, and grew very ignorant of even
the common points of Christianity, all devotion now being
placed in hearing sermons and discourses of speculative
and notional things.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The curious attempt, already referred to, made
by Mary Astell to establish a Protestant nunnery
frightened the orthodox Church party. It savoured
to them of Popery. What she aimed at was to lead
women to embrace a higher and more purposeful
life. Her so-called nunnery was a kind of retreat
for ladies where they could carry on religious
exercises and intellectual studies. It was intended
as a haven for those who disliked the frivolities of
society, and desired to pursue serious aims. But the
proposal was not only laughed down, but abused
as a scheme to propagate Roman Catholicism. A
lady, supposed to be Lady Elizabeth Hastings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
offered to give £10,000 for the building, but was
deterred by the false reports spread by terrified
Protestants.</p>

<p>Mary Astell’s book, “A Serious Proposal to
Ladies,” deserves to be remembered as a unique
work in that period. She was a reformer who, in
the present day, would have been in the front rank
of the workers for the advancement of women.
She pleaded as much for mental as moral improvement,
and perceived very clearly the disadvantages
under which the women of the day laboured with
their flimsy education and the discouragement of
all attempts to follow a more rational system.</p>

<p>Bishop Atterbury’s remarks on Mary Astell
may be quoted as illustrating the surprise felt by
cultivated ecclesiastics at the display of literary
ability in women. Writing to Smalridge in 1706,
he <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I happened, about a fortnight ago, to dine with Mrs.
Astell. She spoke to me of my sermon, and desired me
to print it (the sermon was delivered on the election of the
Lord Mayor); and after I had given her the proper
answers, hinted to me that she would be glad of perusing
it. I complied with her request, and sent her the sermon
next day. Yesternight she returned it, with this sheet of
remarks, which I cannot forbear communicating to you,
because I take them to be of an extraordinary nature,
considering they come from the pen of a woman. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
one would not imagine a woman had written them. There
is not an expression that carries the least air of her sex
from the beginning to the end of it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The bishop does not divulge the exact nature
of Mary Astell’s remarks, but, as he takes them
in such good part, they were probably not
unfavourable to himself. The fact that a woman
was capable of literary criticism which was not of a
feminine tone filled him with astonishment.</p>

<p>Among the women most noted for piety and
good works in the seventeenth century was Mary,
daughter of the Earl of Cork, and wife of the Earl
of Warwick, a warm friend of the Puritans. The
Countess, although a Churchwoman, seems to have
found no difficulty in breathing the theological
atmosphere of her husband’s household, where
Puritan discourses were frequently heard. She was
born in the year of the accession of Charles I., 1625,
and lived to see some eighteen years of the Restoration.
Her biographer, Dr. Walker, speaks of her
as “great by her tongue, for never woman used one
better.” She is also said to have been “great by
her pen,” and “great in her nobleness of living
and in her free and splendid hospitality;” likewise
“great in her conquest of herself and the mastery
of her passions.” She was very strict in the
observance of her religious exercises, and in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
influence on the company about her is enigmatically
described as “like a spiritual stone.”</p>

<p>The Countess of Warwick was no less esteemed
as a mistress than as a landlord, and</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“as a neighbour she was so kind and courteous, it advanced
the rent of adjacent houses to be situated near her. Not
only her house and table, but her countenance and very
heart were open to all persons of quality in a considerable
circuit; and for the inferior sort, if they were sick or
tempted, or in any distress of body or mind, whither
should they go but to the good Countess, whose closet or
still-house was their shop for chirurgery, and herself (for
she would visit the meanest of them personally) and
ministers whom she would send to them, their spiritual
physicians?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Lady Warwick not only acted the Lady Bountiful
among the poor, distributing beef and bread
regularly to the needy of four parishes, but she
extended her charity to the cause of education.
The poor children she placed in schools; scholars
she provided with means to go to the university,
and the meagre salaries of ministers of religion she
supplemented out of her abundant wealth.</p>

<p>Then there was Lady Elizabeth Hastings,
daughter of the Earl of Huntingdon, who aided
missionary work abroad, and spent freely in her
own neighbourhood on charitable works; the
celebrated Lady Russell, wife of Lord William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Russell; Bishop Burnet’s wife, together with others
of less fame, who were known for their piety and
active benevolence. A careful examination of this
period will reveal much individual effort put forth
by women under that strongest of all motive-forces&mdash;the
religious impulse, but little organized
work, either secular or otherwise, for the bettering
of humanity.</p>

sixteenth and seventeenth centuries&mdash;Attitude of the Puritans&mdash;Origin
of the witch&mdash;First use of the term&mdash;Enactments against
witchcraft&mdash;The Essex persecutions&mdash;The last judicial execution.</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">There</span> is one aspect of women’s relation to the
Church in the period under review which cannot
be passed over without some brief notice, although
any detailed examination of the subject would be
impossible in a book of this scope and purpose.
The subject of witchcraft, which has filled so many
hundreds of volumes, is, after all, only a branch of
a still larger subject&mdash;superstition. The beliefs of
one age are the superstitions of the next, but it is
sometimes difficult to say where the dividing-line
should be drawn, for while a belief is not necessarily
a superstition, a superstition has frequently the force
and reality of a belief. The belief in witchcraft was
very slow in passing into the phase of a superstition.
Both the Catholic and the Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Church for many centuries denounced witchcraft
as one of the greatest forms of evil, to be withstood
by every possible means. To doubt its reality was
to doubt one of the articles of faith. At certain
periods in history, the persecution of witches broke
forth like one of the great physical plagues that
from time to time scourged Europe. The belief
in witchcraft was a moral pestilence, insidious, far-reaching,
and deadly in its effects.</p>

<p>Magic and sorcery have been believed in from
the earliest times of recorded history. But although,
in the first centuries of the Christian Church and
throughout the Middle Ages, there was a dread
of the black art, and those who practised it were
liable to numerous punishments, and to death itself,
there was, curiously enough, far less persecution
than prevailed in later and more enlightened periods.
The twelfth and thirteenth centuries were worse
than the sixth, and the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries were far more persecuting periods than
the twelfth and thirteenth. Michelet, writing
generally of the fourteenth century, says the witch
saw before <span class="locked">her&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“a horrible career of torments lighted up for three or four
hundred years by the stake. After 1300, her medical
knowledge is condemned as baleful, her remedies are
proscribed as if they were poisons.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
With the uprising of the Protestant Church in
the sixteenth century came a great wave of superstition.
In the reign of Elizabeth, Bishop Jewell,
preaching before the queen (1568), <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It may please your Grace to understand that witches
and sorcerers within these few last years are marvellously
increased within your Grace’s realm. Your Grace’s subjects
pine away even unto the death, their colour fadeth, their
flesh rotteth, their speech is benumbed, their knees are
bereft. I pray God they never practise <em>further than upon
the subjects</em>.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">There was no doubt about the sincerity of the
bishop’s belief. “These eyes,” he said, “have seen
most evident and manifest marks of their wickedness.”
The reformers were the strongest believers in and
the bitterest persecutors of witchcraft. Not even
Innocent VIII., who, in 1484, promulgated a Bull
against witchcraft and heresy, and thereby gave a
great impetus to the persecution on the Continent,
was more virulent against witches than Luther.
“I should have no compassion on these witches,”
said Luther, in a discussion on witchcraft. “I
would burn all of them.” And he adds, “Witchcraft
is the devil’s own proper work.”</p>

<p>In Scotland, where the Reformed Church
exercised great sway, the persecution was much
keener than in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“When a woman had fallen under suspicion, the minister
from the pulpit denounced her by name, exhorted his
parishioners to give evidence against her, and prohibited
any one from sheltering her.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the seventeenth century the belief in witchcraft
was much fostered by the Puritan party, who were
the bitterest of persecutors. The Puritans were
diligent students of the Old Testament, and doubtless
considered that they had full warrant for their action
from certain much-quoted passages in Scripture.
The Puritans, like the Fathers in the Early Christian
Church, had a very real belief in and horror of the
power of supernatural evil; and, like the Fathers,
they too believed that women were more inherently
wicked than men&mdash;that they were more liable to
assaults of Satan, and more easily drawn into
communion with evil spirits.</p>

<p>Numerous as were the punishments inflicted
upon sorcerers and magicians, the persecution of
witches was far greater. King James I., in his
“Demonology,” asks, “What can be the cause that
there are twentie women given to that craft where
there is only one man?” And he gives as his
reason that women are frailer than men, quoting
the fall of Eve as the beginning of Satan’s
sovereignty over womankind. There was, however,
a more obvious reason for the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
women were so much more frequently denounced
than men for practising the black art. The chief
doctors and surgeons in former times were women.
There was no formulated science of medicine down
to the seventeenth century, but certain persons,
generally women, acquired a large amount of
knowledge of the properties of plants useful for
healing, and methods of distilling and mixing
vegetable juices. The healing art, like nursing,
fell into the hands of women, and herbal lore was
transmitted from mother to daughter, just as skill
in cookery and in special kinds of needlework was
handed down. Deftness, appreciation of detail,
quick observation, and patience supplied the place
of written knowledge. The conditions of life during
the Middle Ages, and even down to the last century,
were such as to afford plenty of scope for the
exercise of practical ability. The women who
had the greatest knowledge of the properties of
plants were, naturally, those most dependent on
nature&mdash;women of the poorer class, but women
endowed with a greater share of insight, and larger
brain power than their companions. The “wise
women,” who usually dwelt alone in some humble
dwelling remote from their neighbours, and “lived
on their wits,” were naturally regarded with a tinge
of awe by the ignorant, and were credited with some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
supernatural power. Their appearance and their
habits&mdash;the result of poverty and loneliness&mdash;caused
them to be looked upon with suspicion. To a
wrinkled, repulsive visage was frequently united a
temper equally obnoxious, and which was embittered
by the gibes and sneers which were freely cast at the
“old hag,” whose weapon of defence was her tongue.
The curses which she poured forth on her tormentors
inspired dread, and if by chance some bodily
affliction attacked the cursed ones, it was invariably
attributed to malevolence. All sorts of ills were
ascribed to the spite of these outcasts of society:
the maiming of cattle, the withering of pasture,
diseases bodily and mental, misfortunes of every
kind. The witch was never a bringer of good;
she was always thought to be working evil, with or
without motive. Women have been credited, not
only by the ignorant multitude, but by philosophers,
with the power, at certain seasons, of turning milk
sour, making dogs savage, and effecting other things,
by their mere presence.</p>

<p>It is not until the twelfth century that there
is any definite mention of witchcraft in England.
This seems strange when it is remembered that in
the time of the early Britons what was known as
magic or sorcery was practised by the wives of the
Druid doctors. These women were noted for their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
skill in herbal medicine, and even credited with the
power of causing evil as well as healing wounds.
But the term “witch” does not seem to have come
into use until the period mentioned. The twelfth
century has been described by Mr. Lecky as the
turning-point of European intellect. The first
glimmerings of incredulity were showing forth.
The Church became aware of some opposing force,
and assumed the offensive. Circumstances that had
hitherto passed unnoticed were regarded as danger-signals.
Any evidences of unusual capacity for
controlling physical forces, such as the “medicine
women” showed, were regarded with hostility.
Their power implied converse with Satan, for by
no other means was it supposed that such knowledge
and skill could be obtained. There was at
that time a widespread belief in the supernatural,
in the presence of evil spirits who infested the
earth in all sorts of shapes to torment and deceive
men. The theory that the wise woman was an
emissary from the Prince of Darkness accorded
with the popular delusions. The witch gradually became
a distinct personality, a figure which troubled
every society. Diseased imagination united to
ignorance of physical science caused the belief in
witchcraft to become a terror for centuries.</p>

<p>Witchcraft offered a solution of the problem of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
evil. How otherwise to account for the ills which
beset humanity? It is difficult for us to realize
the panic which took possession of people’s minds
at the appearance of misfortunes such as plague,
famine, drought, floods, and the like. The terrible
pestilence, for which we can now to some extent
account, appeared like a visitation of Providence
or the direct work of Satan to an age which
knew nothing of the laws of health, of the courses
of disease, and very little of the structure and
functions of the bodily organs. As time advanced,
the belief in the power and malevolence of the
women called witches increased. The Church,
following in the steps of those Fathers who had
credited women with being endowed with special
capacity for evil, commenced a virulent persecution
of witches. In the reign of John a woman was
tried for witchcraft, but there was little detailed
mention of such trials until the fourteenth century.
In the year 1324 there was a celebrated case in
Ireland, and this, the first trial of which we have
any full account, was not that of some mis-shapen,
miserable old woman living in a hovel, but a woman
of good social rank and possessed of wealth, Lady
Alice Kyteler, of Kilkenny. The lady’s troubles
arose partly out of her excessive liking for matrimony.
She had four husbands, and the principal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
count against her was that she had made away
with these husbands by magic. There was at this
period in the Papal chair a pope who held strong
views on the subject of sorcery, Pope John XVII.,
and who issued the first Bull promulgated against
it. Through the instrumentality of one of his Irish
bishops, Lady Alice Kyteler and others were denounced
as sorcerers, the Lady Alice being accused
of causing the death of her various husbands, and
having converse with evil spirits. The arbitrary
action of the ecclesiastical authorities excited so
much dissatisfaction that even the Lord Chancellor
expostulated with the bishop, but received as reply
that the Church was above all law. The Lady
Alice, after being excommunicated, finally escaped
from the priestly meshes, and retired to England,
where she died. During the trial a woman, who
declared she had received instruction in magic arts
from Lady Alice, was flogged six times by order of
the bishops.</p>

<p>There were, however, no regular enactments
against witchcraft until the reign of Henry VIII.
Up to that time, unless the supposed sorceress
was also accused of the crime of poisoning, she
was not condemned to death. But in 1541, conjuring,
sorcery, and witchcraft were all put together
as crimes for which capital punishment could be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
inflicted. Statutes against witchcraft were also
enacted in the reigns of Elizabeth and James I.</p>

<p>John Wier, a physician of Cleves, wrote a
treatise in 1563, in which he described witches as
lunatics labouring under Satanic influence. All
women he considered to be peculiarly subject to
delusions created by malignant agency, and witches
he regarded, in fact, as exaggerated examples of the
inherent moral weakness of the female sex.</p>

<p>With the rise of Puritanism in the seventeenth
century came a second great wave of superstition.
The stern theology of the men of the Commonwealth
was embittered by the darkest of beliefs. They
were always looking for direct manifestations of the
power of evil. It was their conviction that Satan
was embodied in the persons of the unhappy
women who were called witches, and that to hound
them to death was a religious duty. The Puritans
held with great firmness that a curse rested on
womanhood. They found it quite easy to believe
that certain women were specially chosen instruments
of evil, for the whole sex they regarded as
created for the trial and temptation of men. Undoubtedly
the Puritans did much to enforce respect
for women at a period when licentiousness was rife.
They had an honest desire to raise the standard
of public morals, and preserve order and decency.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
But they were actuated more by a desire to guard
men from evil than by a reverence for womanhood.
Though individually they made good husbands and
fathers, their theology was a relentless creed, which
permeated their lives with hard, unsympathetic
views, and condemned sinners without mercy. The
intense vitality of their belief in the omnipresence
of evil clouded their perceptions and blurred their
judgment. Hence their readiness to believe in
witchcraft, and the savagery of their persecution.</p>

<p>Scripture, they said, was on their side. They
pointed to the Witch of Endor, and to the declaration,
“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.”
All sorts of gruesome ideas had grown up and
been handed down as to the power of witches, and
became more widespread and intensified by the
fanatical zeal of the Puritans. It was not until the
second half of the seventeenth century that the full
fury of the persecution blazed forth, though previously
there had been frequent trials and executions.
Thus in the early part of the reign of James I.,
who was responsible for much of the persecution,
a woman was tried and hanged at King’s Lynn.
A sailor had thrown a stone at her boy, whereupon
she cursed the sailor roundly, and hoped his fingers
would rot off, which happened two years later.
Then she got into a quarrel with a neighbour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
who was seized with violent pains, and felt the
bed rocking up and down. The woman was denounced
as a witch and condemned to death. Like
other innocent persons accused of crime, she at
last got to believe what her enemies said of her,
and actually brought herself to confess that she had
practised unholy arts.</p>

<p>In 1645 there was a great outbreak of persecution
in Essex. In 1664 occurred the celebrated
trial of witches at Bury St. Edmunds. There were
living at Lowestoft two lone women whose temper
and demeanour caused them to be disliked by the
inhabitants of that little fishing hamlet. From the
children they endured much petty persecution, and
were treated as outcasts by the adult population.
Nobody would even sell them fish. The two
victims, who were inappropriately named Amy and
Rose, cursed and prophesied evil things. Some
children were seized with fits, during which they
declared they saw the two women coming to torment
them. After eight years of accusations, the
women were brought to trial. Sir Matthew Hale
presided, expressing his belief that the Scriptures
proved the reality of witchcraft. The women were
hung, which was the common mode of dealing with
them. In Scotland they were usually burnt.</p>

<p>There is no need to multiply instances. During<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
the sittings of the Long Parliament, as many as
three thousand persons are said to have been executed,
exclusive of those who were “done to death”
by enraged mobs. In 1640 a witch is described in
a contemporary publication <span class="locked">as&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“the devil’s otter-hound living both on land and sea, and
doing mischief in either; she kills more beasts than a
licensed butcher in Lent, yet is nere the fatter; she’s but a
dry nurse in the flesh, yet gives such to the spirit. A witch
rides many times poast on hellish business, yet if a ladder
do but stop her, she will be hanged ere she goes any
further.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The last judicial execution took place in England
in 1716, when a woman and her daughter, aged
nine, were put to death at Huntingdon, accused of
selling their souls to the devil. But years after
this date the persecution continued, and women
were assailed by the rabble as witches, frequently
dying of the injuries they received. The penal
statutes against witchcraft were repealed in 1751.
This, however, did not do away with the belief
which was held by people in various classes of life.
John Wesley was perhaps the last noted person
who clung to what eventually became a mere superstition,
which only survived in obscure places.</p>

<p>After the Restoration came in a different temper
and view of life. On the one side were the gay and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
frivolous, who mocked at the grim Puritan with his
terrific beliefs; on the other were the philosophers
and the intellectual world, who explained by natural
causes the so-called supernatural appearances. The
Anglican Church held a middle course between the
sceptics and the fanatics. There were some, like
Joseph Glanvil, who, in 1681, took up the defence
of witchcraft; and there were bishops who promulgated
persecution. The clergy had a strong leaning
to superstition, and inclined to the side of the
fanatics; but they were restrained from the greatest
excesses of the Puritans by the influence of the
educational portion, whose learning and enlightenment
reflected credit on the Church at a period
when it greatly needed strengthening.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">It</span> is in the seventeenth century, remarkable for
political and religious strife, and a general unsettling
of society, that the history of the fine arts, as far as
women are concerned, really begins. There is, in
fact, very little to record of the progress of the arts
in England before this period. Unfavourable as
the age seemed for artistic progress when the public
mind was so largely occupied with momentous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
questions affecting the national life, it was signalized
by three notable events, viz. the introduction
of women to the stage, the commencement of
English opera, and the uprising of female painters.
The dramatic revolution, as it may be called, being
the most striking of these events, will be touched
upon first.</p>

<p>The middle of the seventeenth century, when
women first began to appear on the stage in
England, was a period of unexampled laxity. It
was not simply that morality was at a low ebb, and
that the passions reigned uppermost. That was
the case in feudal times when the intellectual side
of humanity was only half awakened, and the range
of interests and ideas, of taste and knowledge, was
limited by physical obstacles. The world was a
sealed book to mediæval men and women. But
the seventeenth century had no such excuse. It
had opened the clasps; it had the power of choice,
but it hugged the sins of past ages to its breast.
Seeing the good, it chose the evil.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate moment for the introduction
of actresses, and their presence gave rise
to many scandals, but abuses had long been rife
on the stage, and dramatic performances had been
occasionally suspended even in the reign of Elizabeth.
The blame cannot be attributed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
pernicious example of France as far as the plays
themselves are concerned, for it is agreed that
French comedy in the reign of Charles II. was
not in the least coarse. This was the period
of Molière’s fame. Two or three years after the
accession of Anne, who did not countenance playhouses
by her presence, the Puritan party of that
day earnestly hoped that the Queen might be induced
to interdict stage performances, or at least to
prohibit certain pieces. There is not the slightest
doubt that the complaints made of obscene language
and manners were well founded. The plays remain
as witnesses, and the record of the scenes enacted
in the green-room and the general licence indulged
in by the players furnish condemnatory evidence.
But the purists were not content with trying to
uphold morality and public decency. At that time
natural phenomena were still regarded by many
people with superstitious terror. Sickness, storms,
and other calamities were looked upon as the visitations
of wrathful Providence.</p>

<p>Now it happened that a disastrous tempest had
been raging, a tempest fiercer than any known for
many years. A day of fasting and humiliation had
been appointed, and in the face of that public acknowledgment
of national sin the irreverent players
chose to produce <cite>Macbeth</cite> and <cite>The Tempest</cite>, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
as faithful a representation of real storms as they
could contrive.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Surely,” writes one shocked contemporary, “the
Players have little reason to expect that they shall still
go on in their abominable Outrages; who, ’tis to be
observed with Indignation, did, as we are assured, within
a few days after we felt the late dreadful storm, entertain
their audience with the ridiculous Representation of what
had filled us with so great Horror in their Plays called
<cite>Macbeth</cite> and <cite>The Tempest</cite>, as if they designed to Mock
the Almighty Power of God, <em>who alone commands the
Winds and the Seas, and they obey him</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Queen Anne did not suspend the plays, but
she issued an edict for the better regulation of
the theatres. With a view to abolishing abuses
and indecencies, it was <span class="locked">commanded&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“that no person of what quality soever presume to go
behind the scenes or come upon the stage either before
or during the acting of any play; that no woman be
allowed or presume to wear a vizard mask in either of the
theatres,”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">together with several other regulations.</p>

<p>It was customary in the days of Charles II. for
ladies to go to the theatre masked, the presumption
being that the language of the plays was so coarse
that no woman could sit and hear them in mixed
company with her face uncovered. But it was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
practice that was liable to lead to all sorts of disorders.
Under the disguise of the mask women
of all degrees accosted strangers, and there were
always men ready enough to avail themselves of
the general licence as to behaviour. Ladies then
sat in the pit, which, after the boxes, was the most
aristocratic portion of the house, for which the
prices ranged from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> in the money of
that period.</p>

<p>The custom of having women to act was introduced
from the Continent, where it had long
prevailed. At the time when Corneille’s plays were
constantly being acted, about 1633, there were a
good many actresses on the French stage. There
was much dramatic activity in Paris at that time.
The French were very eager playgoers, and when
a tragedy having, for its subject the story of
Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn was produced, there
was such a rush to see the piece that four doorkeepers
were crushed to death on the first night,
greatly to the pride and delight of the author, Jean
Puget de la Serre, who exclaimed with triumph:
“Voilà ce qu’on appelle de bonnes pièces.” In his
exultation he declared he would not yield the palm
to Corneille, until his great contemporary had caused
<em>five</em> doorkeepers to be killed in one day.</p>

<p>In the prevailing state of easy morals in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
England of the Restoration the appearance of
actresses was an incentive to licence, and every
advantage was taken of the innovation by the
court gallants. The actresses were probably no
worse than many of the ladies in the audience,
but their mere existence gave occasion for evil.
Evelyn, whose code of morals and taste were too
high for that period, says, in 1666, that he hardly
ever goes to the <span class="locked">theatres&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“for many reasons now, as they were abused to an atheistical
liberty. Fowle and indecent women now, and never
till now, were permitted to appear and act.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Thomas Brand, a Puritan, expressed great delight
when he heard that certain actresses had been
hissed and pelted. The first result of bringing
women on to the stage was to give the rein to
more unbridled licence than before in the manners
of the court and of society.</p>

<p>It was the presence of Queen Henrietta which
brought over a French company of players with
women among them to England in 1659. They
established themselves at the celebrated theatre
in Blackfriars. But whether their distinguished
countrywoman was unable or unwilling to do anything
on their behalf, they were very roughly received,
less because of the women in the company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
than because they were foreigners. Their advent
gave Prynne an opportunity for venting his indignation.
To the stern Puritan the sight of women
on the boards was a great additional aggravation.
No English company seems to have introduced
women till 1660. Pepys, who, as every one knows,
was an indefatigable playgoer, records that the
first time he saw women act was on January 3,
1660. This was at the Theatre Royal, Clare
Market, the play being <cite>The Beggar’s Bush</cite>. Three
days later he saw actresses in Ben Jonson’s play,
<cite>The Silent Woman</cite>. It has been said that <cite>Othello</cite>
was the play in which women first appeared in
England, at a performance given on December 8,
1660. Mrs. Anne Marshall, Mrs. Sanders (afterwards
to become famous as Mrs. Betterton, a most
successful impersonator of Shakespeare’s female
parts), Mrs. Margaret Hughes, and Mrs. Coleman
were among the first actresses who appeared in
public. Mrs. Betterton, whose character was unexceptionable,
was selected to give lessons in
elocution to the two princesses, Mary and Anne,
daughters of James II.</p>

<p>A sort of precedent for women acting in stage
plays was to be found in the court performances.
It was not till the reign of Charles II. that professional
actresses appeared in public, but Queen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Anne, wife of James I., was accustomed to take
an active part in the masques performed at court,
where she was both actress and manager.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> That
these were not mere impromptus may be gathered
from the fact that the cost of a performance often
exceeded £1000. In the reign of Charles I. the
ladies of the court, headed by the Queen, Henrietta
Maria, played a French pastoral at Hampton Court
to enliven the Christmas season. The French
Queen was very favourably disposed towards the
stage, and when the churchwardens and constables
in 1631 petitioned Archbishop Laud to get Blackfriars
Theatre removed, on the ground that it was
a nuisance to trade and the public generally, and
begged that the council would see to the matter,
the answer was returned that the queen was “well
affected towards plays, and that therefore good
regulation is more to be provided than suppression
decreed.” Various members of the aristocracy also
took to the stage, or rather the actors under their
protection. One of the most constant supporters
of the dramatic art was the Countess of Holland,
daughter of Sir Walter Cope, whose husband had
been executed in 1649. Holland House, Kensington,
was frequently the scene of dramatic entertainments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Women are now so necessary to stage performances
that it is odd to find arguments gravely set
forth in favour of their presence. The reasons
assigned for introducing women were that men
failed to act women’s parts satisfactorily; that boys
were no more suitable than girls, and some of the
“boys” were middle-aged men, who could not
properly impersonate young maidens. When in
the reign of Charles II. patents were granted to
Killigrew and Davenant for their theatres, the
following regulations <span class="locked">appeared&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“And forasmuch as many plays formerly acted do contain
several profane, obscene, and scurrilous passages, and the
women’s parts therein have been acted by men in the
habits of women at which some have taken offence; for
the preventing of these abuses for the future we do strictly
charge, command and enjoin that from henceforth no new
plays shall be acted by either of the said companies containing
any passages offensive to piety and good manners,
nor any old or revived play containing any such offensive
passages as aforesaid, until the same shall be corrected
and purged by the said masters or governors of the said
respective companies from all such offensive and scandalous
passages as aforesaid. And we do likewise permit and
give leave that all the women’s parts to be acted in either
of the said two companies from this time to come may be
performed by women, so long as these recreations which by
reason of the abuses aforesaid were scandalous and offensive
may by such reformation be esteemed not only harmless
delights, but useful and instructive representations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
of human life, by such of our good subjects as shall resort
to see the same.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The character of the plays acted in the seventeenth
century fitted the temper of the times.
Wycherley, Congreve, Mrs. Aphra Behn, and
their brothers and sisters in the craft were not
too outspoken for the taste of that day. Evelyn,
it is true, was a severe censor, but he was a man
of the world who had travelled and seen many
things. “In London,” he says, “there were more
wicked and obscene plays permitted than in all the
world besides.” And this, too, in Lent, which added
much to the offence.</p>

<p>It is said that the audiences give the tone to
the stage, and that a moral and cultured public
would purify the drama. The audiences of the
Restoration period did not certainly perform their
part towards effecting such a consummation. Their
behaviour in the playhouse has often been noted.
They showed plainly that low jests and coarse
allusions were to their taste and what they
expected, and they would have scoffed at or yawned
over more decorous language. If the piece were
not to their liking they treated the performers with
scant ceremony, and hissed and pelted them. Such
demonstrations were the more frequent owing to
the custom of caricaturing living persons. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
actresses, when not playing, moved about in the
front rows of the auditorium among their admirers.
Then, again, the occupants of the pit would make
audible comments on the ladies sitting in the boxes,
who did not disdain to retort, greatly to the amusement
of the rest of the house. The theatre was
the rallying point for adventurers and libertines of
both sexes, and served many purposes besides its
legitimate one of entertainment.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century, when the custom of
toasting ladies prevailed, plays were given “for the
entertainment of the new Toasts and several Ladies
of Quality.” This always brought a crowded
audience. The auditorium was frequently the
scene of quarrels, and the custom of allowing
spectators to stand about on the stage was the
cause of much disorder. On one occasion, in 1721,
a regular fray occurred, owing to the presence of
some tipsy noblemen; and the king, George I.,
gave orders that thenceforth a guard of soldiers
should protect the actors during the performance.
One could not expect in that age to find any
regard paid to the sentiments of women, and
omissions made from the plays lest their susceptibilities
should be wounded. Yet this was
done in one instance certainly,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and the passage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
left out was not one of peculiar coarseness, but one
which vaunted man’s superiority over woman.
Those were not the days of equal rights between
men and women, and there could hardly have been
many women who would have been offended at
the claims of the male sex to supremacy. Dr.
Trusler, writing of the eighteenth century, <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“Many of our comedies are improper for a young lady
to be seen at; as, indeed, there are few English comedies
that a modest girl can see without hurting her delicacy.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The attentions of the audience to a popular
actress were a little overwhelming at times. A
knot of admirers would gather round the door of
a lady’s dressing-room, and insist upon escorting
her home. As late as the middle of the century
the manners of the gallery were so rough that it
was no uncommon thing for an orange to be flung
at a lady in court dress.</p>

<p>Whatever condemnation the stage incurred in
the seventeenth century, it was, whether deservedly
or not, quite as much held up to opprobrium in the
eighteenth. A tract, published in 1726 by William
Law, after describing the playhouse as a “sink of
corruption and debauchery,” goes on to <span class="locked">say&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“This is not the state of the Play House through any
accidental abuse, as any innocent or good thing may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
abused; but that corruption and debauchery are the truly
natural and genuine effects of the stage entertainment.”</p></blockquote>

<p>But in spite of the abuses that existed in
connection with the stage, the fact remains that
all through the eighteenth century there was a
succession of actresses whose celebrity was not
confined to their own age. The mere mention
of the names of Mrs. Oldfield, Mrs. Porter, Peg
Woffington, Mrs. Cibber, Kitty Clive, and, later,
the incomparable Sarah Siddons, Miss Farren, and
Mrs. Jordan, recalls the glories of the playhouse
and the privileges enjoyed by audiences of those
days.</p>

<p>In the last century it would have seemed
scarcely less absurd to question the propriety of
having women to act than it would now. The
difference in the course of little over fifty years
was marvellous. There is no department of the
fine arts in which women have progressed with
so much rapidity as in acting. It is hardly necessary
to record the triumphs won by popular
actresses, or to chronicle the successes which have
marked the career of numbers who are not in the
first rank. Women have entered upon the stage
as upon their natural inheritance. Their presence
has stimulated the talents of their male compeers.
The attempt to represent human nature with only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
one half of humanity seems absurdly futile to later
generations, who find it impossible to conceive of
stage performances in which the players were all
men.</p>

<p>It has been seen how the first advent of women
on the stage was productive of increased licence
and freedom of manners&mdash;an almost inevitable
result considering what the age was, and the
novelty of the experiment. The influence of the
drama in England, and the important part which
it has played in the development of our social life,
have been very widely discussed. Those who
view the stage as a great educator, and those&mdash;a
dwindling number&mdash;who regard it as a debaser of
public morals, can both find apt illustrations to
prove their contentions. But whichever standpoint
be taken, the stage, in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, was far more than at the
present day the national recreation. There were
fewer counterbalancing attractions.</p>

<p>The Puritan party as a whole, of course, held
the stage in horror, but more than one actress
whose name has come down to us was descended
from a stern Republican&mdash;like Anne and Rebecca
Marshall, who were said to be daughters of a
divine of the Long Parliament. The dissoluteness
of the stage was in part attributable to the Puritan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
spirit which kept the soberer members of the community
from countenancing the theatre by their
presence, and deterred some from entering the
dramatic profession. Stage-acting was decried as
a calling to which only the debased would resort,
and there were plentiful exhortations to those who
valued their soul’s welfare to abstain from looking
upon corrupting sights. It was difficult, especially
in the seventeenth century, for women of unblemished
reputation to go on the stage without
being besmirched with the vices of the worst of
their companions. Many of the mistresses of
Charles II. and his courtiers belonged to the
theatrical profession. But the century which delighted
in the fascinations of Nell Gwynn, in the
beauty of Moll Davies, which watched the performances
of Prince Rupert’s mistress, Mrs. Hughes,
saw also the famous Mrs. Betterton, of unquestioned
virtue, and such actresses as Mrs. Bracegirdle and
Elizabeth Barry. There never has been a time
when the stage has been without women of high
repute as well as brilliant talent to uphold its
honour.</p>

<p>It is not until the reign of Charles I. that there
is any record of women artists. The first efforts
of English artists were directed to the illumination
of manuscripts. It was for several centuries the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
only kind of art worth mentioning in England.
There were, it is true, clever goldsmiths and workers
in precious stones. It was the custom to have
books, especially religious books, richly bound and
ornamented. Jacquetta, Duchess of Bedford, gave
a missal with gold clasps, which had belonged to
the Duchess of Portland, to her nephew, Henry VI.
But there was little painting of pictures, except of
the rudest kind, up to the seventeenth century.
And, as far as women are concerned, the record is
absolutely bare. They do not even appear among
the illuminators. But with the days of Vandyck’s
residence in England begins our roll of female
artists. Anne Carlisle shared the royal patronage
with the great Flemish painter, whom she outlived.
She was a great favourite at court, and the king’s
fine taste would not have tolerated an inferior artist.
Then followed a period when the fine arts were
forgotten in the turmoil of war, and crushed by the
gloomy, repressive Puritan spirit. But after the
Restoration, matters changed, and from that time
onwards there is a steadily increasing stream of
artists, though the women are few in number, up
to the present century. The only female painters
of any note in the seventeenth century were those
who obtained royal patronage, like Mary Beale, a
painter in both oil and water-colours, and a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
industrious artist, highly commended by the famous
portrait painter, Sir Peter Lely. Anne Killigrew,
maid of honour to Mary of Modena, Duchess of
York, had only twenty-five years in which to make
a name, but she has secured a niche not only through
her pictures, which included portraits of the Duke
and Duchess of York, but also by her verses.</p>

<p>It is anticipating events to proceed to the days
of Angelica Kaufmann and Mary Moser, but, for
the sake of preserving the continuity of the subject,
a rapid review may be taken of the work done by
women in the last century.</p>

<p>In 1768 the Royal Academy was founded, the
first keeper being George Moser, for many years
manager of a private academy for artists in St.
Martin’s Lane, London. He was the father of Mary
Moser, who, like Angelica Kaufmann, was elected a
member of the Royal Academy, these two being the
only women on whom that honour was conferred.
Both had signed a memorial to George III. in favour
of the foundation of an Academy of Arts. When it
was opened in 1769, Angelica Kaufmann sent two
large paintings, and she continued for years to be
an exhibitor. Mary Moser sent a flower piece in
oils, and two years later a figure subject. After
her marriage with Captain Lloyd she ceased to
appear among the ranks of professional painters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
though she continued to exhibit at the Academy
uninterruptedly until 1779, and at intervals to a
later period, her last contribution being in the year
1800.</p>

<p>Angelica Kaufmann and Mary Moser were
both of Swiss parentage. Angelica’s father was a
native of Schwartzenberg, near Lake Constance, and
George Moser was born at Schaffhausen. Angelica
Kaufmann was born about 1741&mdash;the exact date
is uncertain&mdash;and Mary Moser in 1744. But while
the more celebrated artist spent the years of her
childhood among the beautiful surroundings of
Morbegno, in Lombardy, and on the shores of Lake
Como, and acquired her early training in the
galleries of Milan, Mary Moser was born and
educated in England. Angelica Kaufmann did not
come to this country until 1765, after she had made
a name for herself in Italy, and had helped her
father to decorate the Church of Schwartzenberg
with frescoes, had painted the portraits of several
noble personages, had been warmly praised and
munificently treated by the Bishop of Constance,
and had become the pet of the ladies about the
court of the Governor of Milan, Francis III., Duke
of Modena. It was through Lady Wentworth, the
wife of the English Minister at Venice, Mr. Murray,
that Angelica Kaufmann came to England, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
she was welcomed by artists both English and
foreign, and made much of in the fashionable world.
The painter Fuseli, whom she had already met in
Rome, was desperately in love with her, but she,
unfortunately, fell into the meshes of that arch
adventurer who passed himself off as Count de
Horn, while her fellow-artist, Mary Moser, was
languishing for love of Fuseli, who was indifferent
or blind to her attachment. In 1781 Angelica
Kaufmann married Antonio Zucchi, a Venetian artist,
and left England for Italy never to return. Fuseli
consoled himself with a Miss Sophia Rawlins in
1788, the year in which he was elected Associate
of the Royal Academy, and Miss Moser married
Captain Hugh Lloyd.</p>

<p>Mary Moser, at the time when she and Angelica
Kaufmann joined the ranks of the “Forty,” was
the only flower painter in the Academy, with the
exception of John Baker. If Angelica Kaufmann,
with her brilliant beauty and talents, has eclipsed
her humbler friend, yet Miss Moser contrived to
secure a very fair share of artistic success. She
gained very practical recognition from the royal
family, the Queen commissioning her to paint a
room at Frogmore, for which she was paid £900.
The whole decoration of this room was in flowers,
flower-painting being Miss Moser’s speciality. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
last time she exhibited at the Academy she sent a
figure subject.</p>

<p>Fanny Reynolds, the retiring and unappreciated
sister of Sir Joshua Reynolds, was one of Angelica
Kaufmann’s many friends. Perhaps she did not
object to the romantic devotion paid by her famous
brother to the fascinating young Italian artist who
captivated all hearts. Frances Reynolds had many
difficulties in the way of her artistic studies. She
got no help or even encouragement from her
brother, who, far from tendering her any advice,
disliked to see her paint, and ridiculed her miniatures,
which, he said, “make other people laugh and
me cry.” Perhaps James Northcote, Sir Joshua’s
pupil, was right when he said that Miss Reynolds’s
portraits were an exact imitation of Sir Joshua’s
defects. This would account for the unfavourable
judgment and harsh treatment poor Fanny always
received from her brother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cosway, another of Angelica Kaufmann’s
friends, and one of a very smart circle, first exhibited
at the Royal Academy in 1780. She was
the daughter of an Englishman, or Irishman, named
Hadfield, who kept an hotel at Florence, and sent
his little girl to a convent to be educated. She
wished to become a nun, but was dissuaded from
that course by her mother desiring her company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
when her father died, and the family moved to
England. It was Angelica Kaufmann who eventually
completed the work of converting Maria
Hadfield from a religious to a secular life. Her
husband was an R.A., wealthy, and much admired
as an artist. Mrs. Cosway, like her husband,
painted miniatures, and was very successful. She
also possessed a good deal of musical talent, and
was personally attractive, so that between them
Mr. and Mrs. Cosway made numerous friends and
quantities of money, for Cosway had a keen eye to
business, and could turn everything to account.
Their receptions were noted, and were attended by
artists, men of letters, the most exclusive of the
fashionable world, and also by royalty. But all
this splendour faded away when Cosway took up
the cause of the Revolutionists in France. His
friends turned their backs on him, his wife’s health
failed, their only child died, and the last years of
their married life were spent in a dull house in the
Edgeware Road, London. After her husband’s
death, Mrs. Cosway went back to her native country.</p>

<p>In the closing years of the eighteenth century
there were many landscape painters among women,
but in the early part of the nineteenth century they
declined, very few exhibiting at the Royal Academy.
It was, however, a flourishing period for portrait<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
painters. “Never before or since have so many
lady artists obtained such honours in a most difficult
branch.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> Mrs. Carpenter, who lived between
1793 and 1877, was pre-eminent among these, and
was a regular exhibitor at the Academy from 1814
to 1866. Mrs. James Robertson was a clever
miniature painter, and was elected a member of
the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg. She was
also an exhibitor at the Royal Academy during
the same period as Mrs. Carpenter.</p>

<p>It was not an easy matter at the close of the
last century and the beginning of the present to
obtain instruction in miniature painting, and the
women who excelled did so entirely by their own
laborious efforts. Later on this branch of the art
fell into desuetude. Flower and fruit painting came
much into vogue early in the century. It is a
curious thing that the amateurs of art should
have fallen so much into the background in the
first half of this century. In the last decade of the
eighteenth century the amateurs were rather distinguished.
There were numbers of “honorary
exhibitors” between 1793 and 1800 at the Royal
Academy, who seem to have been so described
because they were amateurs like Miss Spilsbury,
Miss Serres, and other ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
It seems strange that in music women have
shown so little creative power. They have proved
first-class executants, but as composers they have
not attempted any great flights. With a few
exceptions their productions have been confined
to the lighter kinds of music, to songs and the
simpler class of pianoforte works. They have
rarely attempted orchestral pieces or the more
elaborate forms of vocal composition. Symphonies,
oratorios, operas, or even cantatas have very
seldom issued from the pen of a woman. It is
not, however, impossible that creative capacity may
have existed in many women without finding direct
expression or acknowledgment. Mendelssohn narrates
how he was summoned to play before the
Queen, who wished that he should accompany her
in one of his compositions. He asked Her Majesty
to select her favourite song, and when the Queen
had chosen what she called quite the best,
Mendelssohn was obliged to confess that the song
was his sister’s work, not his own. The elder
Mendelssohn would probably have seen more
impropriety in his daughter’s name appearing in
print than in his son taking credit for what he had
not composed. Just as Caroline Herschell’s large
share in her brother’s astronomic labours and Fanny
Mendelssohn’s authorship were not acknowledged,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
so is it impossible to say that musical genius may
not have been the heritage of some among the
women of famous composers’ families.</p>

<p>But women have always delighted in playing
and singing, even in those early periods of our
history when music in this country was chiefly a
thing of ear and memory, there being hardly any
musical literature and very few professional
instructors. In the middle ages, throughout the
Renaissance period, and down to the last century,
music was part of polite education for both
sexes. At the present day a gentleman may go
comfortably through life with no more, if as much,
knowledge of music as a Board School child, and
not be accused of lack of breeding. For a woman
in the middle and upper ranks, music has remained
an essential feature of education. Indeed, it has
been made far too much of, and many years are
often wasted in attaining a very moderate degree
of executive skill, with little pleasure or profit, by
those who have not sufficient natural ability to make
prolonged study useful.</p>

<p>In the present century the musical education of
women has made great strides. Every opportunity
has been taken for latent talent to develop by
means of the best instruction. The academies and
schools of music have raised the standard of private<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
teaching, besides directly educating vast numbers of
students. The result is an ever-increasing number
of really able performers and teachers, but very
few composers. To the executive power of women
there is no limit beyond that of the instrument.
With regard to vocalism, there is the barrier of
climate. We are not a nation of vocalists, and
though there is a very large amount of respectable
talent it is seldom that England produces a great
singer.</p>

<p>One proof of the advanced musical education
of women is to be found in their frequent presence
as performers in high-class orchestras. It used to
be a rare thing to see a woman appear on a concert
platform in any capacity but that of vocalist or
pianoforte player. Now she takes her place quite
naturally among the “strings.” To play in concerted
music means a wider training, and one that has only
become possible to women in recent times.</p>

<p>The English have always been a music-loving
nation. The records of early times show in what
esteem music was held. The harp was the favourite
instrument of our forefathers. The possession of
a harp was one of the three things necessary to a
gentleman or a freeman in Wales, and slaves were
not permitted to play on it. A gentleman’s harp
was never seized for debt, because he would then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
have been degraded to the rank of a slave. The
minstrel was as essential to English social life in
the middle ages as the cook or the henchman.
A writer in the thirteenth century speaks of the
good singers in England at the court of Henry II.
Erasmus in the sixteenth century remarks of the
<span class="locked">English:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“They challenge the prerogative of having the most handsome
women, of keeping the best table, and being most
accomplished in the skill of music of any people.”</p></blockquote>

<p>At that time everybody, high or low, delighted
in music. It was as much a part of education as
reading and writing, and there was never a festival
or entertainment of any kind without music.
Curiously enough, ladies then played the bass viol,
thought by some to be an “unmannerly instrument
for a woman.” The virginal, or as it is generally
called the virginals, a sort of pianoforte; the cittern
and the gittern, which were varieties of the lute
and the guitar, were the instruments most in use
by gentlewomen.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> The virginal is said to have
received its name from being played by young
girls, or, according to some authorities, because it
was an instrument used by the nuns in their hymns
to the Virgin. It was expected of every lady that
she must be <span class="locked">able&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“to play upon the virginals, lute, and cittern; and to
read prick song (<i>i.e.</i> music written or pricked down) <em>at
first sight</em>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>So common was the lute that lute-strings were
much in vogue as new year’s gifts to ladies. Queen
Elizabeth, as is well known, was a skilful performer
on the lute and virginals, and her “Virginal Book”
is frequently referred to in musical works. “Lady
Nevill’s Virginal Book” is another famous collection
of sixteenth-century airs.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth gave great encouragement to
sacred music, and issued express orders for the
retention of the musical portion of the Church
Service, and in her own chapel various instruments
were used. She gave much offence to the stricter
Protestants by her patronage of music.</p>

<p>All through the Tudor period England was
merry with music, but with the triumph of the
Puritans, in the seventeenth century, all this was
changed. Music was denounced as corrupting and
mischievous, like the other arts, and every effort
made to prevent the people’s enjoyment of it, either
in their own homes or in the religious services.
Under James I. there had been little encouragement
given to music, and when the Civil War came,
and the Commonwealth, with its austere doctrines,
was established, there was no chance for musicians.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
The fury of the Puritans against church music was
shown in acts of violence. The organ of Westminster
Abbey was broken down, and the pipes
pawned for ale by roistering republicans. Ordinances
were passed in 1644 <span class="locked">for&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“the speedy demolishing of all organs and all matters of
superstitions, monuments in all Cathedral or Collegiate or
Parish Churches and Chapels throughout the Kingdom.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And even before then havoc had been made of
the church organs. Of the court players no one
knows&mdash;they disappeared. But after the Restoration
the Royal Chapel Choir was re-formed with
some difficulty, for both teachers and performers had
been scattered to the four winds. Then followed
the age of Purcell, Humphrey, Wise, and Blow.</p>

<p>Throughout the seventeenth century, and down
to the time of the second George, ladies continued
to play on the virginals and lute, and to practise
reading music at sight.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“Part of a gentlewoman’s bringing up is to sing, dance,
play on the lute, or some such instrument, before she can
say her <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pater Noster</i> or ten commandments: ’tis the next
way their parents think to get them husbands, they are
compelled to learn.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And just as Englishwomen of the present day are
apt to lay aside their accomplishments after marriage,
so, in the seventeenth century,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“they that being maids took so much pains to sing,
play, and dance, with such cost and charge to their parents
to get these graceful qualities, now being married, will
scarce touch an instrument, they care not for it.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The very maidservants at that period understood
music. Pepys speaks of a servant whom he and
his wife took into their household, a poor, wretched
girl, without proper clothing, but with a decided
talent for singing, apparent even through a voice
described by the diarist as furred for want of use.
This was the fourth maid in the course of less than
ten years whom Pepys praises for musical ability;
and there was also the boy who was in the habit of
playing his lute in bed at four in the morning, a
habit that most employers would object to, but
Pepys saw in it only occasion for praise.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century marks an era in our
musical history, because it witnessed the first attempts
at opera by English composers. Matthew
Lock’s opera, <cite>Psyche</cite>, produced in 1673, was the
first English composition of this class. Henry
Purcell, when he was only about seventeen, wrote
<cite>Dido and Æneas</cite>. It was performed in 1677. Now,
as Madame Raymond Ritter has <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“Woman’s practical career as a musician only began
with the invention of the opera about 1600. It was not
until her superiority as an actress and a singer had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
undeniably and triumphantly established on the stage that
she was allowed to resume her musical participation in
Church services.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Purcell’s opera had a very modest introduction
to the world. It was performed at a girl’s boarding-school,
kept in Leicester Fields by Mr. James
Priest, a famous dancing-master, who persuaded
young Purcell to write the music to the libretto of
the drama which had been composed by one Tate
at his suggestion. Mr. Priest desired to have
something for his pupils to perform, and the exhibition
came off with great <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclat</i> in the presence
of the pupils’ parents and friends.</p>

<p>It is a little surprising that any one should have
been found daring enough to carry out so startling
an idea at a girls’ school, and it seems odd that
Mr. Priest should have been the proprietor of such
an establishment.</p>

<p>The musical history of England affords little
that is encouraging to dwell upon from the middle
of the seventeenth century. A great many foreign
artists visited this country, but native talent was at
a very low ebb. There were no English composers
of any note after Purcell, who died at thirty-seven
years of age, just when Italian opera was beginning
to take root in England.</p>

Blanc’s opinion of the English.</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">“La</span> dix-huitième siècle aime la nature.” The love
of the eighteenth century for nature was, however,
a capricious attachment, a spurious sentiment. No
century so delighted in artificiality. Its dress, its
habits, its amusements, its very speech,&mdash;all bear
witness to its dislike of nature unadorned. It loved
the town and the works of man. The eighteenth
century stands out with a curiously distinct individuality.
The influences that moulded society in
the time of the Stuarts had passed away. The
contest between the moralist and the sensualist
had spent itself. Although the Puritan spirit lived
on, it slumbered awhile, and the open profligacy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
against which it had striven, though not extinguished,
was manifested in less pronounced shapes.
The Church was both lethargic and corrupt. For
the first time in English history we come upon a
period when there was no dominant spiritual
influence. Religion, like everything else, was a
matter of formalism.</p>

<p>Slowly the great characteristics of social life in
England had changed. Romanism and feudalism
had governed it in earlier times. Then came the
Renaissance, with its vivifying power, followed by
the reign of sensuality and the opposing force
of Puritanism. It seemed as if the nation were
exhausted; passion had spent itself, moral feeling
was deadened, enthusiasm was quenched. The
new force was conventionality.</p>

<p>Women in every-day life felt the spell of this
goddess less than did the great ladies. Over the
fashionable world she reigned supreme; but the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, while they admired, and as far as
possible imitated, the ways of their social superiors,
showed themselves more children of nature.</p>

<p>Increase of material ease and comfort was
re-shaping the course of domestic life. As household
arrangements were improved, new appliances
invented, and the general conditions made smoother,
woman’s position changed. She was less completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
occupied with the means of living, and more
open to outside influences. That she invariably
made a good use of her liberty is not so clear.
The prosperous, well-housed citizenesses of the
eighteenth century probably spent much of their
spare time in idle chatter&mdash;it was a great period for
gossip&mdash;and in tricking themselves out to imitate
the fine ladies of whom they got glimpses at church
and in the public gardens. They rose late because
it was fashionable, leaving their servants to do the
work that their grandmothers would have shared.
There is as much lost as gained in the uprooting
of social habits while the people are still unripe for
changes. And the women of the eighteenth century
<em>were</em> unripe. There was more material than
intellectual improvement. The literary movement
hardly touched women in every-day life; the philanthropic
movement had not made any headway,
and as for politics, it was only the great ladies,
with relatives and friends among statesmen, who
concerned themselves with public affairs. Middle-class
women seldom read the newspapers. It was
in the coffee-houses that men learned and discussed
the news of the day; they did not buy the papers
and bring them home in London. In the country
a weekly news-letter was handed from neighbour
to neighbour, or discussed at village inns, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
women-folk usually gathered their news by hearsay,
not finding much to interest them in the curiously
composed, ill-printed medley that called itself a
newspaper.</p>

<p>The women of the middle classes did not keep
pace with the men in enlarging their sphere of
interests. Among the aristocracy women were
naturally drawn more into the current of life by
their connection with leading men of the time, by
their intercourse with distinguished foreign visitors,
by their opportunities of travel and of contact with
the best thought of the day. But the women of
the trading classes were removed from all these
influences. Their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> was a domestic one. The
education which they received was not calculated
to inspire them with any idea that their minds
needed enlarging. It was seldom thought that
women required anything beyond a few accomplishments.</p>

<p>In <span class="locked">Scotland&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“domestick affairs and amuseing her husband was the
bussiness of a good wife. Those that could afoard
governesses for their children had them, but all they could
learn them was to read English ill and plain work. The
chief thing required was to hear them repeat Psalms and
long catechisms, in which they were employed an hour
or more every day, and almost the whole day on Sunday.
If there was no governess to perform this work it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
done by the chaplan, of which there was one in every
family. No attention was given to what we call accomplishments.
Reading and writing well, or even spelling,
was never thought of. Musicke, drawing, or French were
seldom taught the girls. They were allowed to rune
about and amuse themselves in the way they choiced,
even to the age of women, at which time they were
generally sent to Edinburgh for a winter or two to lairn
to dress themselves, and to dance and see a little of the
world. The world was only to be seen at Church, at
marriages, burials, and baptisms. These were the only
public places where the ladys went in full dress, and as
they walked the street they were seen by everybody;
but it was the fashion when in undress all-wise to be
masked. When in the country their employment was in
color’d work, beds, tapestry and other pieces of furniture;
imitations of fruits and flowers with very little taste. If
they read any it was either books of devotion or long
romances, and sometimes both.”</p></blockquote>

<p>These are the words of an Ayrshire lady, whose
reminiscences date back to the early years of the
eighteenth century. She lived up till 1795, during
which time she witnessed a great change in girls’
education. Reading, writing, music, drawing, geography,
history, even French and Italian were
added gradually to the curriculum.</p>

<p>In former periods women were producers as well
as distributors, each household being like a little
township, dependent on itself. But in the eighteenth
century, although domestic industries had not been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
revolutionized as they have since been, there were
factories and shops, and all sorts of hawkers, who
vended goods of various kinds in the streets. In
London and in the large towns there was no need
for each family to produce its own necessaries,
though in country districts the domestic arrangements
were more stationary. Baking, brewing, and
salting were still carried on in the larger houses
occupied by the gentry, but in small households
most of the things required for daily use were
bought. The domestic <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> of the eighteenth-century
woman among the middle classes was not
so absorbing as to leave her no time for mental
recreation. But books, like politics, were, for the
most part, left to the men. There was so little circulation
of literature that in London much of the
reading was done standing at a bookseller’s stall,
a method obviously impossible to women. With
such scanty education as was considered appropriate
to the weaker sex, with no books but of the
most dreary kind, written for young people, it was
little wonder that the generality of girls grew up
without any habit of reading, or of regarding
literature as an essential element of their daily
lives. We cannot think of the average woman in
the last century as finding much of her pleasure
in any intellectual occupation. She had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
neglected, her mind allowed to rust. The awakening
that had taken place two hundred years before
had been succeeded by a reaction, and there was
a general apathy with regard to women’s education.</p>

<p>A writer in the second quarter of the century,
who is vaunting the superiority of men over women,
says England is</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“the place in the world where the fair sex is the most
regarded, and, perhaps, deserves most to be so.... Nor
is it easy to comprehend how it is possible to raise them
higher with any show of reason, considering their natural
incapacity for everything above the sphere they actually
move in.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Foreigners were always struck by the freedom
enjoyed by married women. One observes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“among the common people the husbands seldom make
their wives work. As to the women of quality, they don’t
trouble themselves about it.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The middle-class wife has been pictured for us
by Fielding in the description of Squire Western’s
<span class="locked">wife:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“The Squire, to whom that poor woman had been a
faithful upper-servant all the time of their marriage, had
returned that behaviour by making what the world calls a
good husband. He very seldom swore at her, perhaps not
above once a week, and never beat her. She had not the
least occasion for jealousy, and was perfect mistress of her
time, for she was never interrupted by her husband, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
was engaged all the morning in his field exercises and all
the evening with bottle companions.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever the position of the wife, it was preferred
to that of the single woman.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“An old maid is now thought such a curse as no
Poetick Fury can exceed,” writes the author of “The
Ladies’ Calling,” “looked on as the most calamitous creature
in nature. And I so far yield to the opinion as to
confess it to those who are kept in that state against their
wills; but sure, the original of that misery is from the
desire, not the restraint, of marriage: let them but suppress
that once, and the other will never be their infelicity. But
I must not be so unkind to the sex as to think ’tis always
such desire that gives them an aversion to celibacy; I
doubt not many are frighted only with the vulgar contempt
under which that state lyes: for which if there be no cure,
yet there is the same armour against this which is against
all other causeless reproaches, viz. to contemn it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This supports the remark that women were
more easily won than formerly. An elderly beau
<span class="locked">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“The men of these days are strangely happy. In my
time a fine woman was not to be gain’d without a long
application and a thousand testimonies of an unfeign’d
and constant regard; but now a game of romps or a lucky
run at cards reduces the vanquished fair to accept of what
condition the conqueror is pleased to give.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The modest demeanour of English women when
seen abroad excited the admiration of foreigners,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
who were a little astonished at the general taste for
walking, which is</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“a great diversion among the ladies and their manner of
doing it is one way of knowing their character; desiring
only to be seen, they would walk together for the most
part without speaking, they are always dressed and always
stiff; they go forward constantly, and nothing can amuse
them or put them out of their way.... Yet, notwithstanding
all their care to be seen, they are seldom coquets,
nor have they any ridiculous affectations or bold ways.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was not usual for girls to walk about alone,
and was considered indecorous by the older generation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“I know this age has so great a contempt of the former
that ’tis but matter of scorn to alledge any of their customs;
else I should say that the liberties that are taken now
would then have been startled at. They that should then
have seen a young maid rambling abroad without her
mother or some other prudent person, would have looked
on her as a stray, and thought it but a neighbourly office
to have brought her home: whereas now ’tis a rarity to
see them in any company graver than themselves, and she
that goes with her parent (unless it be such a parent as is
as wild as herself) thinks she does but walk abroad with
jaylour.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Our national fault&mdash;want of taste in dress, and
fondness for new fashions, however unsuitable&mdash;called
forth the censure of an Italian <span class="locked">visitor:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p class="in0">“The ladies of England do not understand the art of
decorating their persons so well as those of Italy; they
generally increase the volume of the head by a cap which
makes it much bigger than nature, a fault which should be
always avoided in adorning that part.... They wear their
petticoats too short behind, and not imitating the most
graceful birds, as the ladies of Italy and France, in a trail
of their robes upon the ground, lose the greatest grace which
dress can impart to a female....</p>

<p>“In truth, not beauty, but novelty governs in London,
not taste, but copy. A celebrated woman of five foot six
inches gives law to the dress of those who are but four
feet two.... There is nothing so common as to hear the
ladies of this nation assure you that such a shape is quite
out of fashion, and the present reigning mode is the slender
or the large; as if the creative power, like the hands of
mantua makers, had cut the human person by a new pattern
and thrown away the old.... This is not the case in Italy
and France; the ladies know that the grace which attends
plumpness is unbecoming the slender; and the tall lady
never affects to look like a fairy; nor the dwarf like the
giantess, but each studying the air and mein which become
her figure, appears in the most engaging dress that can be
made, to set off her person to the greatest advantage.”</p></blockquote>

<p>About the middle of the century quite an outcry
arose about the introduction of so many French
fashions, and the prints of the day are full of
caricatures of French ways and costumes. It was
the upper classes who were first seized with this
mania for imitation, and the example being infectious,
spread rapidly through all ranks of society. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
fashionable world followed France, and the middle
classes followed the fashionable world. The mode
of life, the popularity of public gardens, to which
high and low resorted, brought the ways of the gay
world under the eyes of the staid folk who dwelt
in the city.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“What was looked upon as the beau-monde, then lived
much more in public than now, and men and women of
fashion displayed their weaknesses to the world in public
places of amusement and resort with little shame or delicacy.
The women often rivalled the men in libertinism and even
emulated them sometimes in their riotous manners.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In 1770 an Act was passed <span class="locked">declaring&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“That all women of whatever age, rank, profession, or
degree, whether virgins, maids or widows, that shall from
and after such Act, impose upon, seduce, or betray into
matrimony, any of his Majesty’s male subjects by the
scents, paints, cosmetic washes, artificial teeth, false hair,
Spanish wool, iron stays, hoops, high-heeled shoes, etc.,
shall incur the penalty of the law now in force against
witchcraft and like misdemeanours, and that the marriage
upon conviction shall stand null and void.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Public morals were at a low ebb if we may trust
the observation of that experienced traveller,
M. Grosley, who says that the women of the town
were bolder and more numerous in London than in
Paris or Rome. They thronged the footpaths at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
night, and even in broad daylight accosted passers
by, more particularly those whom they perceived to
be foreigners.</p>

<p>Archenholz, who visited London some years
after Grosley, <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On compte cinquante mille prostituées à Londres,
sans les maîtresses en titre. Leurs usages et leur conduite
déterminent les différentes classes où il faut les ranger.
La plus vile de toutes habite dans les lieux publics sous
la direction d’une matrone qui les loge et les habille. Ces
habits même pour les filles communs, sont de soie, suivant
l’usage que le luxe a généralement introduit en Angleterre.... Dans
la seule paroisse de Marybonne, qui est la plus
grande et la plus peuplée de l’Angleterre, on en comptoit,
il y a quelques années, treize mille, dont dix-sept cents
occupoient des maisons entières à elles seules.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the causes of the number of these <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">filles
de joie</i> was, probably, the constant immigration
from the provinces of young friendless girls eager
to taste the delights of London. When their means
were exhausted it was impossible for them to return
or obtain employment without credentials, and they
entered upon the only career that seemed open
to them.</p>

<p>Another Frenchman comments on the openly
lax morality which disgraced English family <span class="locked">life&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“There’s yet a much greater fault which the English
women have reason to complain of, and that is that most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
of the husbands keep mistresses. Some have carried them
home and made them eat at the same table with their
wives, and yet no mischief happened.... They have been
seen even in company with the wives, and if there is any
distinction, ’tis that they are handsomer for the most part,
better dressed and less starch’d.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“If this be thought an exaggerated portrait,
drawn with the inaccuracy of hasty observation
and coloured by prejudice, the same cannot be said
with regard to the pen of Fielding, who, in “Tom
Jones,” reflects popular opinion and represents the
standard of the day. A young fellow, named
Nightingale, who has betrayed his landlady’s
daughter, is thus addressed by his <span class="locked">uncle:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Honour is a creature of the world’s making, and the
world has the power of a creator over it, and may govern
and direct it as they please. Now, you well know how
trivial these breaches of contract are thought: even the
grossest make but the wonder and conversation of the
day. Is there a man who afterwards will be more backward
in giving you his sister or daughter, or is there any
sister or daughter who would be more backward to receive
you? Honour is not concerned in these engagements.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be remembered how “Squire Western,”
when he heard that “Tom Jones” had betrayed
a village girl, laughed at the episode as a good
joke, and called upon his daughter to bear him out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
that women would think no worse of a young
fellow for that. As for “Sophia” herself, it proved
no serious check on her passion.</p>

<p>And yet England was said to be the country
where offences against women were punished with
the greatest severity, and where, if a man wished
to find an unlawful partner, he must search among
those whose poverty made them ready victims to
temptation.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that women of the middle
classes were accustomed to expect a lower standard
of morality among men than at the present day.
The novels of the last century show that what are
now deemed as grave offences were then considered
mere peccadilloes. Drinking and swearing were
foibles too common to excite notice, and breaches
of the moral code were easily condoned. The
women were not so prone themselves as might
have been thought to the sins which they tolerated,
but they were brought up in the belief that a larger
licence should be allowed to men. The same
tendency is apparent now in circles where the
women take little or no share in the occupations
of their husbands and brothers, and where the
interests are totally different. The women, who
are the most ready to be lenient where they should
be severe, set up different standards of morality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
for the sexes, and draw a dividing-line between
masculine and feminine virtues and vices.</p>

<p>What greatly impressed Frenchmen was the
seriousness of English wives, and their sober, chaste
lives.</p>

<blockquote>

<p xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Au milieu des débordemens, souvent poussés à l’excès,
dans cette grande ville, il est bien rare de voir la corruption
attaquer une femme mariée, et chercher à lui faire partager
ses infames plaisirs. Elle trouve un rempart insurmontable
dans son amour pour sa famille, les soins de son
ménage, et sa gravité naturelle. Je soutiens même qu’il
n’y a pas de ville dans le monde où l’honneur des maris
soit moins en danger qu’à Londres.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Another <span class="locked">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Le part qu’ont les femmes au sérieux et à la mélancolie
nationale en les rendant sédentaire, les attache à
leurs maris, à leurs enfans, et à leur ménage.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Le Blanc remarks, with a touch of wounded
<span class="locked">vanity&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Most of those who among us pass for men of good
fortune in amours, would with difficulty succeed in addressing
an English fair. She would not sooner be
subdued by the insinuating softness of their jargon than
by the amber with which they are perfumed.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Naturally a Frenchman thought his own countrywomen
more <span class="locked">attractive&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The women in France are not so reserved as in
England; but we find charms in their company which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
those of this country have not. The one, by their awkwardness,
have the defect of making virtue itself disagreeable;
the others, more engaging, have often the
pernicious art of making vice seem amiable.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There were those who complained that in
<span class="locked">France&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“women have too much boldness, and are scarcely women.
The continual commerce between the sexes causes, as it
were, an exchange of characters which makes each sex
derogate something from its proper character. They (the
women) drink hard at table, and do it agreeably. They
understand gaming as well as men. They go a-hunting
with men, and come so near to men in everything that
they are scarcely women.”</p></blockquote>

<p>What would have been thought of the modern
Englishwoman who rides to hounds, wears masculine,
tailor-made clothes, and shares the serious
occupations as well as the amusements of the male
sex, it is needless to discuss. In the last century
pursuits that are now quite common, and pass
without notice, were thought extravagantly fast,
while our ancestors tolerated a licence of manners
and speech that we, in our turn, should repudiate.</p>

<p>There was considerable difference between the
manners and habits of town dwellers and those
living in the country. An article in <cite>The Female
Spectator</cite>, in 1745, recounts a country lady’s experiences
on her first visit to London, and her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
amazement at the habits of London folk. She went
to call on an old acquaintance with whom she had
at one time been extremely <span class="locked">intimate:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It was between eleven and twelve when I came to her
door, where, after knocking a considerable time, a footman
with his nightcap on, and pale as just risen from the dead,
came yawning forth, and on my asking for his lady, ‘O
Gad, madam,’ drawled he out, ‘we had a racquet here last
night, and my lady cannot possibly be stirring these three
hours.’ I wondered what had happened, but would not
ask any questions of the fellow, and only left my name
and said I would wait on her at a more proper time.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The lady returns about three o’clock, after shopping
and dining, and thus describes her <span class="locked">visit:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I had now the good fortune to be admitted, and found
her at her chocolate; she had a dish of it in one hand, and
with the other she seemed very busy in sorting a large
parcel of guineas, which she divided in two heaps on a table
that stood before her. She rose and received me with a
great deal of civility and kindness, told me she was sorry for
my disappointment on my first calling, but added with a
smile that when I had been a little while in town I should
learn to lie longer in bed in a morning.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After this the London lady explains to her
country visitor the meaning of the term racquet,
viz. when the number of company assembled for
cards exceeded ten tables; if it were fewer, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
entertainment was called a “rout,” and if there were
only two tables it was a “drum.”</p>

<p>To the bewildered visitor the amusements of
London folk seemed very odd, and she adds that
she found cheating at cards almost as fashionable
as cards themselves.</p>

<p>As the stage-coach system developed country
people came more to London, and Londoners
began to pay periodical visits to watering-places,
whither they carried the dissipations of town life.
The love of scenery is a taste that has been largely
developed within the present century. When people
travelled formerly, if it were not for business, it was
to comply with fashion and for the excitement of a
change, but not to revel in the beauties of Nature.
The eighteenth century was full of artificial sentiment.
It disliked in women the evidences of
health and of a robust constitution of mind. The
effect on ordinary women was to make them shallow
and affected. They were not taught to think; they
were encouraged to believe that appearances counted
for everything, reality for nothing. As long as the
exterior was pleasing, it mattered not what was
beneath.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When a poor young lady is taught to value herself on
nothing but her cloaths and to think she’s very fine when
well accoutred; when she hears say, that ’tis wisdom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
enough for her to know how to dress herself, that she may
become amiable in his eyes, to whom it appertains to be
knowing and learned; who can blame her if she lay out
her industry and money on such accomplishments, and
sometimes extends it farther than her misinformer desires
she should....</p>

<p>“If from our infancy we are nurs’d upon ignorance and
vanity; are taught to be proud and petulent, delicate and
fantastick, humorous and inconstant, ’tis not strange that
the ill-effects of this conduct appears in all the future actions
of our lives.... That, therefore, women are unprofitable
to most, and a plague and dishonour to some men is not
much to be regretted on account of the men, because ’tis
the product of their own folly, in denying them the benefits
of an ingenuous and liberal education, the most effectual
means to direct them into, and secure their progress in the
ways of vertue.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The flirtation with literature, the coquetting
with accomplishments which passed for female education,
were shams, like the powdered <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pouffs</i> of hair
and the face-washes. It was an age of shams, and
women were told, in effect if not in words, that
successful shamming was their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> in life. They
were to sham sensitiveness, modesty, ignorance
(which could not have been difficult), anything and
everything which it was deemed likely would commend
them to the perverted taste of the day. The
vapourish, hysterical, fainting heroines of romance
are only slightly coloured pictures of reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
The physical effects of the system of education
were as harmful as the results on the mind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“Miss is set down to her frame before she can put on
her clothes; and is taught to believe that to excel at the
needle is the only thing that can entitle her to general
esteem.... One hardly meets with a girl who can at the
same time boast of early performances by the needle and
a good constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p></blockquote>

<p><cite>The Female Spectator</cite> issued a protest against
that devotion to the needle, which was regarded as
one of the cardinal virtues in <span class="locked">women:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Nor can I by any means approve of compelling young
ladies of fortune to make so much use of the needle, as they
did in former days, and some few continue to do. In my
opinion a lady of condition should learn just as much of
cookery and of work as to know when she is imposed upon
by those she employs in both those necessary occasions, but
no more. To pass too much of her time in them may
acquire her the reputation of a notable housewife, but not
of a woman of fine taste, or any way qualify her for polite
conversation, or of entertaining herself agreeably when
alone. It always makes me smile when I hear the mother
of fine daughters say, ‘I always keep my girls at their
needle.’ One, perhaps, is working her a gown, another a
quilt for a bed, and a third engaged to make a whole dozen
of shirts for her father. And then when she has carried
you into the nursery and shewn you them all, add, ‘It is
good to keep them out of idleness; when young people have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
nothing to do, they naturally wish to do something they
ought not.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the second half of the century, when the influence
of the fashionable world was more strongly
felt among the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, the boarding-school, with
its flimsy accomplishments and its lack of solid
education, began to attract the daughters of a
different class. Hitherto it had been the monopoly
of the so-called gentlefolk, but now mingling with
these were the daughters of tradesmen and farmers,
who had money to spend and a fancy for making
“ladies” of their girls. It may have been a step
up in the social ladder for these newcomers, but
from an educational point of view it was no gain.
The training of the fashionable boarding-school was
only a veneer.</p>

<p>To the French it seemed odd and unnatural to
see English parents sending their children off to
boarding-schools, or to be educated abroad at the
convent schools of Paris. In France young girls
were kept at home with their mothers much more
than in England.</p>

<blockquote>

<p xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Les parens se débarassent de leurs enfans,” writes La
Combe in his “Tableau de Londres,” “en les jettant au
hazard dans des pensions ou des académies. Ils semblent
rougir de voir leurs enfans se former sous leurs yeux; ils
prefèrent des étrangers, qui n’ont ni attachement ni la<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
connaissance des passions des enfans qu’on leur confie, et
les elévent tous avec indifférence sur le même plan. Il
serait plus raisonnable d’avoir les enfans chez soi, d’étudier
leur goût, leur penchant, de les façonner peu à peu par la
douceur et les caresses, à la docilité au travail, à l’honnêteté
et de les familiariser insensiblement avec tout ce qu’ils
doivent savoir un jour et pratiquer dans la société. On est
étonné, à Paris surtout, lorsqu’on voit arriver de jeunes
Anglaises dans les couvents. Quoi? dit on, les mœurs
sont donc bien corrompues à Londres pour nous charger
d’élever les demoiselles.”</p></blockquote>

<p>As the century grew older the habits and
amusements of the leisured classes spread to the
trading community.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“I will not presume to say that all the misfortunes the
city of London at present labours under are owing to their
preposterous fondness of following the fashions of the
court; but that they are in a great measure so I believe
most people will readily enough agree to.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Speaking of a City dame who had taken up with
the fashions of the West-end, the same writer
<span class="locked">observed&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“A great courtier now become, she looks with contempt
on her former fellow-citizens, joins in the laugh coquets
and beaus set up whenever any of them appear, and sees
not that herself is equally an object of ridicule to those
she is so vain of imitating. Thus despising and despised
without one real friend, she lives a gawdy, glittering,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
worthless member of society, and endured by those whose
example has rendered her such, on no other account than
that immense wealth which they find means to share with
her, while she imagines they are doing her an honour.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The busy merchants and traders whose wives
were so eager to be in the fashion were themselves
no less anxious to be up to the times.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“I do not but see that the men are as eager to quit
their compting houses and strut in the drawing-room
disguised in a long sword and taper wig as the women can
be in a new brocade, exactly the same pattern with that of
one of the Princesses. The infection has spread itself
pretty equally through both sexes. And the husband has
little to reproach the wife with, or the wife the husband,
but what each are guilty of in the same degree.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Merchants and bankers, in spite of the cares
of business, took life very easily, spending the first
part of the morning in the coffee-houses, and, after
a couple of hours at the Exchange, going home to
dinner at four o’clock.</p>

<p>The manners and customs of the eighteenth
century accentuated the differences of sex, and set
up artificial barriers between men and women.
Foreigners, because they heard politics constantly
discussed, and forming the chief interest of the
citizen’s life, and because they saw the wife acquiesce
in her husband’s views, concluded that politics
proved a strong bond of union in family life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Cet intérêt repand dans le domestique un nouvel
agrément: le mari y trouvant toujours quelqu’un avec
qui il peut traiter à cœur ouvert, aussi longuement et aussi
profondement que bon lui semble, les objets qui l’interessent
le plus.”</p></blockquote>

<p>As has been noted elsewhere, interest in politics&mdash;especially
politics which dealt in personalities&mdash;was
keen enough among the women of the
aristocracy, for the game was being largely played
by their own friends, but the women of the middle
classes were generally indifferent to public affairs.
Except on occasions of great public excitement,
the City madam, the country squire’s lady, and
the farmer’s wife knew little of what was stirring
in the world of statecraft. They lumped together
politics and pipes as part of the men’s amusements
with which they had no direct concern. They
shared their husbands’ views because they had
none of their own, and it was not worth while
troubling their heads about such matters as changes
of Ministry, Bills in Parliament, and so forth.</p>

<p>Occupations and habits caused men and women
to lead separate lives. Hard riding and hard
drinking were the recreations of the country squire;
the farmer had his out-door duties; the tradesman
had his apprentices to superintend; the shopkeeper
had no suburban residence, and was a shopkeeper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
all day long while the shutters were open. The
wife occupied herself with her store-cupboard, her
linen-press, and her kitchen, and gossiped in her
parlour with neighbours over a dish of tea.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The English,” wrote Le Blanc, “lose a great deal in
conversing so little with the sex whom Nature has endowed
with the graces, and whose company has constant charms
and a certain sweetness not to be found in that of men.
The conversation of women polishes and softens our
behaviour; by the habit we acquire of endeavouring to
please them, we contract a tone of voice equally agreeable
to both sexes....</p>

<p>“The custom of living with what is most valuable in
both sexes, makes the pleasure and happiness of life....
And ’tis by too much neglecting this custom that the
English have a certain disagreeable bluntness in their
character.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In this century many things have occurred to
modify the differences in the habits of the sexes,
to bring men and women more into the same current
of ideas, occupations, amusements. To a much
greater extent than formerly the evolution of women
is proceeding along the same lines as the evolution
of men. In the last century men regarded women
<span class="locked">as&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“made only to take possession of their hearts, and seldom
or never to afford any amusement to their minds. They
prefer the pleasure of toasting their healths in a tavern to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
that of chatting with them in a circle. They treat them
as if they had been as much of another species as of
another sex. For the most part they look on them as
good for nothing but to dissipate their vapours or ease the
fatigue of business.”</p></blockquote>

<p>They now regard them as comrades instead of
playthings.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IIc"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE GREAT LADY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">London society in the last century&mdash;Lord Chesterfield on taste&mdash;Coarse
language of great ladies&mdash;The speculation mania among
ladies&mdash;Narrowness of fashionable life&mdash;Manners and amusements&mdash;Difficulties
of social intercourse&mdash;The founders of
Almack’s Club&mdash;The passion for politics&mdash;Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu on women’s training&mdash;Some traits of eighteenth-century
life.</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">After</span> the turmoil of the Stuart period was over,
and the country had settled down under the rule of
the dull Hanoverians, social life in England assumed
a new form. The circles of the great ladies who
now come into prominence, partly through their
wealth and dignities, but more on account of their
qualifications as leaders of society, eclipse the
circles gathered in royal palaces. Until the
eighteenth century society consisted of factions.
There was a court party and a party strongly
opposed to the court; there were court beauties
and favourites, duly hated by the opposite set. In
London there were mansions where revels were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>
held by great families, but there was no cohesion
among the scattered elements of London life. It
was only in the seventeenth century that it became
fashionable to keep a town as well as a country
house, or rather to spend the winter in London in a
house hired for the season, which then included the
darkest and coldest months in the year. London
was only just beginning to be made the centre of
all that was most brilliant in social life, and society’s
leaders were still, for the most part, performing
their functions at their country estates.</p>

<p>But in the eighteenth century London has its
well-established social circles, which take the lead
in all matters of fashion and taste, having first
acquired the tone from Paris. It was in the second
quarter of the century that the question of taste
was always uppermost in polite circles, according to
Lord Chesterfield.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Taste,” he writes, “is now the fashionable word of the
fashionable world. Everything must be done with taste;
that is settled, but where that taste is is not quite so
certain, for after all the pains I have taken to find out
what was meant by the word, and whether those who use
it oftenest had any clear idea annexed to it, I have only
been able negatively to discover that they do not mean
their own natural taste, but on the contrary, that they have
sacrificed it to an imaginary one, of which they can give
no account. They build houses in taste, which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
cannot live in with conveniency; they suffer with impatience
the music they pretend to hear with rapture, and
they even eat nothing they like, for the sake of eating in
taste. Eating, itself, seems to me to be rather a subject
of humiliation than pride, since the imperfection of our
nature appears in the daily necessity we lie under of
recruiting it in that manner, so that one would think the
only care of a rational being should be to repair his
decaying fabric as cheap as possible. But the present
fashion is directly contrary; and eating now is the greatest
pride, business, and expense of life, and that, too, not to
support, but to destroy nature.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There was certainly a want of taste in the
language used by great ladies, whose speech was
often so coarse as not to bear repetition. One day
the Duchess of Marlborough called upon Lord
Mansfield, the Lord Chancellor, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incognita</i>. When
the clerk went in to the Chancellor to announce the
visitor, he said: “I could not make out, Sir, who
she was, but she swore so dreadfully that she must
be a lady of quality.” The substance of ladies’ talk
was also open to censure. Writes Swift:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Or how should I, alas, relate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sum of all their senseless prate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their Inuendo’s, Hints, and Slanders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their meanings, lewds, and double entanders!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now comes the general scandal charge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What some invent the rest enlarge.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Expressions then in common use among ladies
would not be tolerated now in decent society. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
their intercourse with men they were more restrained,
at least in writing, but the attitude of the
sexes towards each other was one peculiar to the
age. There was so much affectation of gallantry on
the part of the men, and such a want of straightforwardness
on the part of the women, that the
whole tone of society was thoroughly artificial.
Between the wits, statesmen, men of letters, and
the great ladies of their acquaintance there was a
romantic kind of relation worthy of the days of
chivalry. The elaborately framed protestations of
devotion to which women were generally quite
ready to listen belonged rather to feudal romance
than to real life. But the romance of the eighteenth
century was tinctured with the spirit of banter, and
both sides were well aware that the whole thing
was merely put on, like the powder and the patches.
So general was this playing at sentiment that when
real feeling for once in a way tried to get the
ascendant it was unable to obtain credence.</p>

<p>The fashionable dames of the eighteenth century
loved to dabble in politics, which afforded a
fresh excitement when the social round began to
grow a little flavourless. The eighteenth century
was a great period for letter-writing, and political
news was a constant topic of correspondence. The
interest centred on men rather than on principles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
These great ladies, when they wrote to each other
or to their friends of the male sex, did not discuss
causes. They were concerned with individuals,
with the career of the gentlemen of their acquaintance.
Looked at in this way, politics were, in the
phraseology of the age, “vastly” entertaining.</p>

<p>When the rage for speculation came in, the
ladies became ardent speculators. They exchanged
confidences and congratulations over the great
South Sea Bubble, before it burst, and hoped that
“stocks were going on prosperously.” Mrs. Molesworth,
writing to Mrs. Howard (Countess of Suffolk),
in June, 1720, <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To tell you the truth, I am South Sea mad, and I
find that philosophic temper of mind which made me
content under my circumstances, when there was no
seeming probability of bettering them, forsakes me on
this occasion; and I cannot, without great regret, reflect
that for want of a little money, I am forced to let slip
an opportunity which is never like to happen again.
Perhaps you will think me unreasonable when I tell you
that good Lady Sunderland was so mindful of her absent
friends as to secure us a £500 subscription, which money
my father had laid down for us, and it is now doubled;
but this has but given me a taste of fortune, which makes
me more eager to pursue it. As greedy as I seem, I
should have been satisfied if I could by any means have
raised the sum of £500 or £1000 more, but the vast price
that money bears, and our being not able to make any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>
security according to law, has made me reject a scheme
I had laid of borrowing such a sum of some monied
friend.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The ladies got their men friends, with whom
they corresponded copiously, to gamble for them.
Thus the Duke of Argyll, in 1719&ndash;20, acted for
the Countess of Suffolk, and invested for her a
large sum of money in the Missouri scheme,
informing her from time to time how things were
going.</p>

<p>The taste for speculation was worse than the
taste for French fashions, which was decried by
Lord Chesterfield.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I do not mean to undervalue the French,” he writes.
“I know their merit. They are a cheerful, industrious,
ingenious, polite people, and have many things in which
I wish we did imitate them. But, like true mimics, we
only ape their imperfections, and awkwardly copy those
parts which all reasonable Frenchmen themselves contemn
in the originals. If this folly went no farther than
disguising both our meats and ourselves in the French
modes, I should bear it with more patience, and content
myself with representing only to my country folks that
the one would make them sick and the other ridiculous;
but when even the materials for the folly are to be brought
over from France too, it becomes a much more serious
consideration. Our trade and manufactures are at stake,
and what seems at first only very silly is, in truth, a great
national evil and a piece of civil immorality.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
The great lady of the eighteenth century is
always, so to speak, in full dress. She seems to
live in and for society, to be the leading figure in
a great show. It is difficult to think of her except
with a train and an elaborate <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coiffure</i>, with her fan
and smelling-bottle and her grand manner <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en
princesse</i>. The elaboration of life in the fashionable
world, the affectations of speech and manner,
and the imposing costumes surround her with an air
of artificiality. Though she might be an ardent
politician or a brilliant wit, though she might
achieve fame in the world of letters, she lived in
a narrow circle. The great social movements of
the country were as nothing to her. The history
of the classes below her own had no meaning for
her mind. Court intrigues, political changes, were
events of moment; they were part of her world;
she knew no other. Her outlook was limited to
personal interests and ambitions. The accident of
birth gave her a part to play in the affairs of the
world. And she played it like a great lady, whose
proper business is pleasure. She flirted, intrigued,
and cajoled; suffered herself to be alternately flattered
and neglected when she wanted a place at
court or to worm out some political secret for a
friend. But of the healthy, broad interest which
regards the politics of to-day, both home and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
foreign, as the history of the morrow, she was
generally devoid.</p>

<p>The great lady of the eighteenth century, unless
she happened to be gifted with exceptional breadth
of view, was indifferent&mdash;often contemptuously indifferent&mdash;to
matters outside her own fashionable
circle. Her education and the temperament of the
age fostered this feeling. She had not the domestic
responsibilities of women of a lower grade, or of
great ladies of former times. In their place she
was offered the distractions of society. One by one
her duties had fallen away from her. Domestic
occupations did not form part of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> of a great
lady then any more than at the present time. The
altered conditions of life gave her leisure; the
increase of luxury begat a distaste for exertion.
There was a great deal of licence of manners
allowed to women, but little real freedom. They
could not venture out of the beaten track without
incurring ridicule, and possibly insult. In all the
relations of life they were made to feel they were
dependent beings. As daughters they had the
inferior portion, and no profession but marriage.
As wives they had nothing at all of their own,
not even their children&mdash;a condition only remedied
late in the present century. But the lack of all
interest in their children, which was said to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
characteristic of the French nobility, was not so
marked in England. In France it was considered
very <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeois</i> to be surrounded by a family.
Husbands and wives commonly lived independent
lives. “Une mariage uni devient une anomalie
dans le grand monde, un manque de goût.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>It was the attitude in which women were regarded
that affected their position more than the
actual existence of repressive or deteriorating
customs. And to public opinion the great lady
was both more susceptible and more subject than
other women, for she lived with all eyes upon her.
Without a great deal of moral courage she could
not step out of her bounds or revolt against the
conditions of her life. A narrow mental horizon,
a cramping education, united with wealth and high
place, were not favourable to the evolution of women,
morally or intellectually. In the eighteenth century
women moved in a circle, from the meshes of which
they were not freed until the present century had
run half its course.</p>

<p>With all the elaborate airs and dress which prevailed
in the eighteenth century there was a coarseness
of taste and behaviour which is in odd contrast
to the exaggerated politeness affected by <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beaux</i> and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élégantes</i>. There seems a good foundation for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Walpole’s description of the gaiety of the women
as “an awkward jollity.” The diversions of the
great ladies read strangely to our modern ears.
What would be thought now of dukes and
duchesses going about London with their friends in
hired vehicles to see the sights? But in the spring
of 1740, the Duke and Duchess of Portland organized
a jaunt (as one of the party described it) to the
City to see the City show-places. There were four
ladies and four gentlemen, and they set out at ten
o’clock in the morning in a couple of hackney
coaches, made a comprehensive tour, and wound up
by dining at a City tavern. “I never spent a more
agreeable day,” writes one of the ladies of the party.</p>

<p>The fashionable diversions, balls and routs,
were repeated over and over again at every
watering-place.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Pleasure with an English lady is a capital and rational
affair. A party at Bath is perhaps the fruit of six months’
meditation and intrigue: she must feign sickness, gain
over the servants, corrupt the physician, importune an
aunt, deceive a husband, and in short have recourse to
every artifice in order to succeed, and the business at last
is to get fully paid for all the pains that have been taken.
Pleasure is so much the more attractive to the English
women as it is less familiar and costs them more to obtain.
Melancholy persons feel joy more sensibly than those who
are habituated to it.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
Amusements had no background of broad
general interests. It was inevitable that their
effect should be enervating. Some fresh zest was
wanting, and it was found in a licentiousness of
manner, just as flavour was added to conversation
by doubtful anecdotes. A phrase in general use
was “demi-reps.” It was the fashion to abbreviate
words, and “rep” was commonly used for “reputation,”
a thing in constant danger of being lost or
destroyed at tea-tables. Walpole, writing in the
last quarter of the century, notes with pleasure and
surprise the unusual occupations of some of his
fair friends, who busied themselves with carving
and decorative work to adorn the interior of their
houses.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“How much more amiable,” he says, “the old women
of the next age will be than most of those we remember
who used to tumble at once from gallantry to devout
scandal and cards, and revenge on the young of their own
sex the desertion of ours. Now they are ingenious. They
will not want amusement.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The great ladies of the eighteenth century sadly
wanted amusement, for they had nothing else to
fill up their time. It was not fashionable to be
philanthropic, to start societies for the propagation
of new social creeds. And there were not nearly
so many diversions. There was no fishing in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Norwegian fjords in the summer, no autumn shooting-parties
among the Scotch moors, no winter
trips to the Riviera. At Bath, Tunbridge Wells,
and other spas whither the fashionable world
resorted, the social round was only varied by the
bathing and drinking. The bad state of the roads
often afforded diversion to the young, and many a
merry mishap befell parties returning from festivities
in the country. It certainly added to the excitement
of a ball to know that there was every probability
of being overturned on the road, or having to ford a
stream swollen by the rain. The vivacious Elizabeth
Robinson (afterwards Mrs. Montagu) describes
how greatly she relished a break-down of the carriage
on the return journey after a ball in the country.</p>

<p>The highwaymen who haunted the outskirts of
London lent a melodramatic colour to all assemblies
after dark. Even in broad daylight people who
had anything to lose traversed unfrequented roads
with fear and trembling. Certainly these conditions
of social life averted the danger of monotony.</p>

<p>Looked at from another side, the great lady of
the eighteenth century bears favourable comparison
with the great lady of modern times. She was a
more distinct individual influence in society than
her successors. And yet neither then nor later had
we <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salons</i> comparable to those in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Il n’y a pas à Londres comme à Paris des bureaux de
femmes de bel esprit. Les auteurs anglais ne consultent
pas les femmes; ils ne mendient pas leurs suffrages. Les
affaires publiques intéressent le beau sexe anglais, mais il
ne s’ingère pas de décider entre les intérêts de l’opposition
et de la cour. Les femmes dans le monde, ne parlent ni de
guerre, ni de politique, pratiquent leur religion et ne discutent
point des dogmes. En général les femmes anglaises
sont douces, modestes, et vertueuses.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But there were notable society leaders, such as
the ladies who founded Almack’s Club, some of
whom, like Lady Molyneux, were beauties who set
the fashions. Almack’s, which was opened in 1765,
was a club for both sexes, on the model of the
men’s club at White’s. Ladies nominated and
elected the men, and the men chose the ladies.
The founders were Mrs. Fitzroy, Lady Pembroke,
Mrs. Meynel, Miss Pelham, Miss Lloyd, and Lady
Molyneux.</p>

<p>Better known to after generations are the names
of the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, the Duchess
of Rutland, Lady Mary Chudleigh, the sisters Gunning.
Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, whose most intimate
friend was the Duchess of Portland, collected
the wits and brilliant talkers, and made Montagu
House a rallying-point for all that was most attractive
in society. The Countess of Suffolk was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>
at one time the centre round which court gossip
revolved. Lady Caroline Petersham kept up the
pace with her frolics and jaunts. There was the
more strictly political set, who were perpetually
discussing the action of Ministers, and the probable
effects on themselves and their friends. The ladies
in this set, impelled largely by personal motives,
were as keen about political moves as any party
wire-puller.</p>

<p>“Our ladies are grown such vehement politicians
that no other topic is admissible,” writes
Walpole in 1783, the year of the memorable Westminster
election. He complains that</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“politics have engrossed all conversation and stifled
other events, if any have happened. Indeed, our ladies
who used to contribute to enliven correspondence are
become politicians, and, as Lady Townley says, ‘squeeze
a little too much lemon into conversation.’”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">There was a good deal of acrimony imported into
the atmosphere of political circles, partly because
of the strong personal element pervading all politics.
The weakness of eighteenth-century society
was its narrowness. It cared nothing, comparatively
speaking, for large general questions.
The literary set discussed books and authors, but
society in general did not care very much about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>
literature. A new poem or a new romance were
matters of interest because new; it was the correct
thing to show acquaintance with the latest productions
in verse or prose. Politics absorbed a
great many in the fashionable world, but chiefly
on the ground of personal interest. Society lived
in a kind of mental stays.</p>

<p>The great ladies of the eighteenth century do
not seem to have thought of work as a distraction
when pleasures began to pall. They would have
been bored to extinction at the idea. The worship
of work is a characteristic of the nineteenth century.
Those who do not work for profit work for the
sake of the occupation, at some self-imposed task.
The great philanthropic current, using the adjective
to describe all forms of social amelioration, has
drawn into its stream numbers of recruits from the
so-called leisured classes. Indeed it is the members
of this class who largely carry on works of general
usefulness. England has become the country of
volunteers in the public service.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century worshipped idleness.
It looked upon labour as ignoble. This view of
life had its effect on the bringing-up of girls in the
higher ranks. They were bred to idleness as their
proper vocation. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,
writing to her daughter, Lady Bute, in 1753,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
about the education of the Countess’s daughter,
<span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I could give many examples of ladies whose ill-conduct
has been very notorious, which has been owing to that
ignorance which has exposed them to idleness, which is
justly called the mother of mischief. There is nothing
so like the education of a woman of quality as that of a
prince: they are taught to dance, and the exterior part of
what is called good breeding, which if they attain, they
are extraordinary creatures in their kind, and have all the
accomplishments required by their directors. The same
characters are formed by the same lessons, which inclines
me to think (if I dare say it), that nature has not placed
us in an inferior rank to men, no more than the females of
other animals, where we see no distinction of capacity;
though I am persuaded that if there was a commonwealth
of rational horses (as Dr. Swift has supposed), it would
be an established maxim among them that a mare could
not be taught to pace.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The life of a great lady in the eighteenth
century is well reflected in the contemporary
literature. The satires of poets, the strictures of
moralists, the raillery of wits, bring before us the
social side of the period in numberless ways. A
lady who was not a politician or a blue-stocking
killed time by rising late, spending several hours
over an elaborate toilette, and preparing herself for
the gaieties of the evening. The eighteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>
was in some respects a period of inanition. The
formalism which pervaded its literature was seen in
another aspect in the social life of the age. There
was a general want of the sympathetic spirit. Each
circle in society lived shut up within itself, not
knowing, nor caring to know, how the rest of the
world went on. The narrowness of this attitude
told more strongly on the wealthy classes, who had
not the stimulus of being obliged to make an effort
for the satisfaction of any desire. Social progress,
as a recent writer has observed, is not the product
of the intellect, but is due to the altruistic spirit.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
This spirit was asleep in the eighteenth century.
In previous centuries there had been more progress
with fewer opportunities. During periods of
unrest women’s energies were called forth to cope
with difficulties which a later civilization smoothed
away. Family life, even for great ladies, offered
scope, in times past, for the constant exercise of
activity in the discharge of functions which lapsed
in more refined ages. The leisure which had been
painfully won in the progress of civilization the
women of the eighteenth century knew not how to
use. They dallied with trifles, yawned out of sheer
vacuity, invented wants to pass the time, were by
turns elated and vapourish, and affected sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>
for the sake of excitement. There were servile
imitations of French manners as well as fashions,
and neither were successful. Instead of progressing
to a wider life, society turned off into a sidewalk
of artificiality and moral inertia.</p>
